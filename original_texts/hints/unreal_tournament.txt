In the Maps directory are a lot of .unr.uz files. In order to get the game to run they have to be decompressed. This script will do the work for us:

cd /usr/local/games/ut/System &&
for FILE in ../Maps/*.uz; do ./ucc-bin decompress ../Maps/$FILE -nohomedir \
  && rm -f $FILE;
done
mv *.unr ../Maps

type ut to run the game
