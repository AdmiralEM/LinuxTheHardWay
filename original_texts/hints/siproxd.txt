SYNOPSIS: 	How to setup siproxd to use a SIP Phone under LFS

DESCRIPTION:	This hint will show you how to use a SIP phone
		with LFS.

PREREQUISITES:	Files listed in hint must be downloaded

HINT:

Introduction:

This hint will help you configure a SIP proxy server for use with LFS.
The one problem with using a SIP phone is generally most of use are not
connected directly to the internet with out phones. The phones are part
of are LAN and have IP addresses that are internal to our network. The
SIP proxy server allows the phone to communicate to the outside and 
makes sure the proper phone gets the calls routed to them.

What is siproxd:

Siproxd is an proxy/masquerading daemon for the SIP protocol.
It handles registrations of SIP clients on a private IP network
and performs rewriting of the SIP message bodies to make SIP
connections possible via an masquerading firewall.
It allows SIP clients (like kphone, linphone) to work behind
an IP masquerading firewall or router.

libosip2

	Before you can setup siproxd you will need to setup lisosip2.

	./configure --prefix=/usr &&
	make &&
	make install

Before Compiling

	Before compiling siproxd you will need to create a user and a group.

	In /etc/passwd add : siproxd:x:117:117::/dev/null:/bin/false

	In /etc/group add : siproxd:x:117:

Compiling

	
        ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc/siproxd &&
	make &&
	make install

Configuring

	To configure siproxd use the following commands to make a siproxd.conf file

	cd /etc/siproxd
	cp siproxd.conf.example siproxd.conf

	Now you will need to change the following entries in the file

	if_inbound  = eth0	to	if_inbound = {Your LAN Interface}
	if_outbound = ppp0	to	if_outbound = {Your Internet Interface}

	#hosts_allow_reg = 192.168.1.8/24 to hosts_allow_reg = {Your LAN Network)

Bootup Script

	#!/bin/bash
	# Begin $rc_base/init.d/siproxd

	# Based on sysklogd script from LFS-3.1 and earlier.
	# Rewritten by Gerard Beekmans  - gerard@linuxfromscratch.org

	source /etc/sysconfig/rc
	source $rc_functions

	case "$1" in
		start)
			echo "Creating IPTables Rules for Siproxd..."
			iptables -A INPUT -i {if_inbound from siproxd} -p udp --dport 5006 -j ACCEPT
			iptables -A INPUT -i {if_inbound from siproxd} -p udp --dport 7070:7080 -j ACCEPT
			echo "Starting Siproxd..."
			loadproc /usr/sbin/siproxd
			;;

		stop)
			iptables -D INPUT -i {if_inbound from siproxd} -p udp --dport 5006 -j ACCEPT
			iptables -D INPUT -i {if_inbound from siproxd} -p udp --dport 7070:7080 -j ACCEPT
			killproc /usr/sbin/siproxd
			echo "Stopping Siproxd..."
			;;

		restart)
			$0 stop
			sleep 1
			$0 start
			;;
		*)
			echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}"
			exit 1
			;;
	esac

	# End $rc_base/init.d/siproxd

Phone/Software Configuration

	You will need to specify the IP address of the server that you loaded
	the software on as the outgoing proxy.

-----
Testing
	
	I am a member of freeworlddialup.com, they provide some test #'s you can
	use. For example 958 would give you your phone #. 612 would give you the
	time.

	Check the providor your using, they may have the same features with different
	#'s.

	You can also call me at 275410, if I'm around I will answer.

Linux SIP Software

	Here are some links for software phones, utilizing your sound card and a microphone.
