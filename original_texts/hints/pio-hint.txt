SYNOPSIS: Package manager "pio" (Package Installation Observer)

DESCRIPTION:
pio is a "timestamper" package manager found useful for (B)LFS 
installations.  It is run once before installation to "take inventory" 
of defined directories, then again after installation.  It observes 
new/changed subdirectories and files, and builds a script which will 
safely remove whatever was installed.  This "removal" script is the 
basis for other tricks it will do.

Above all, pio is a dis-integrated package manager.  It's simply a
hands-on tool to be used.  It enforces nothing!

PREREQUISITES:
pio is entirely bash script, almost 1100 lines of it.  One must 
understand bash to "extend" it or do "maintenance".  Have a care; pio 
makes scripts that WILL remove files!  But being bash script, it can be 
"easily" maintained or extended.

It has no unusual dependencies.

HINT:
Once upon a time there was git, the Guarded Installation Tool, by Ingo 
Brueckl (ib@wupperonline.de) 14.11.1996.  I found it useful for LFS 
builds & added a few functions.  Then Linus made a kernel development 
management tool he chose to call git.  So I changed this script to avoid 
potential confusion.  pio is still almost entirely Ingo's git.  Some 
functionality has been changed.  That's my responsibility.

Refer to pio-usage for real hints on using pio effectively.

pod is a mashup of several ad-hoc scripts I use when building and 
maintaining my packages, mostly interacting with pio.

template is my build script template demonstrating my usage of pio when 
building (B)LFS systems.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
  * Ingo Bruekl for the original git-2.16
  * Paul Rogers for resurrection, maintenance, and extensions.

CHANGELOG:
