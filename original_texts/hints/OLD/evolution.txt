TITLE:		Ximian Evolution 1.0.5
LFS VERSION:	LFS version 3.0 (possibly others, untested as yet)
AUTHOR:		Jason Cooper <my_e-mail_address(at)att(dot)net>

SYNOPSIS:

	Ximian Evolution 1.0.5 is a graphical e-mail client for Linux boxes.  It
also has calendar, tasks, and contacts built in.  Evolution reportedly connects 
to Microsoft Exchange Servers, but I have not tested this, nor am I able to.

	Unfortunately, LFS users cannot download and install (binaries only)
the Evolution program because the binaries available are *very* distro 
specific.  Besides, we prefer to compile from source anyway.

	There are two ways to do this:
		1) Evolution with the Gnome GUI.
		2) Evolution only.

	For the first version of this hint, I will stick to option 1 although I
personally did option 2.  Regretably, I did not document the experience because
I did not realize how complex it would become.

HINT:

	OPTION 1 (Evolution on the Gnome GUI)

Follow the Gnome.txt hint, then return here. 

1) Get the source tarballs.

	bonobo-conf-0.14.tar.gz
	evolution-1.0.5.tar.gz
	gal-0.19.2.tar.gz
	gtkhtml-1.0.2.tar.gz

	From <ftp://ftp.ximian.com/pub/source/evolution/>

2) Unpack the sources.

	cd /usr/src			# or your directory of choice
	tar -xzvf <package-name> 	# Repeat for each package

3) Compile packages in the following order:

	cd bonobo-conf-0.14
	./configure
	make 
	make install		# You must be root
	ldconfig		# It only takes a second, it doesn't hurt,
				#   and it saves a lot of frustration.

	cd ../gal-0.19.2
	./configure
	make
	make install
	ldconfig

	cd ../gtkhtml-1.0.2
	./configure
	make
	make install
	ldconfig

	cd ../evolution-1.0.5
	./configure --with-db3=/usr/local/BerkeleyDb.3.1 	
	make		# WARNING: Evolution requires BerkeleyDb 3.1.17
	make install	# If this does not work, upgrade to 3.1.17, specifically.
	ldconfig	# Refer to the Gnome.txt hint for BerkDb install.
			# If it gets to be intricate, record exactly what you did
			# and send it to me, I'll add it in here.
			# This is what caused me the most problems when I did it
			# with no Gnome UI.
	
4) Pray to your diety of choice, or sit pensively.  Refer to the document 

	evolution-1.0.5/README

to seek insight.  Gnome/Ximian are doing an outstanding job of making clean, easy
to compile source (No, I don't work for them, nor do I use the Gnome UI, I prefer
fvwm2).  Unfortunately, all the libraries are in such a state of flux, it makes 
getting to the end result a pain in the ass.  

	Personally, the one weak point seems to be the BerkeleyDb non-standard
compiling issues...  If you get it to work, please let me know so the hint can be
improved.
