TITLE:		ESD compilation problems
LFS VERSION:	any
AUTHOR:		Wan <unknown>

SYNOPSIS:
	Compiled normally, ESD doesn't work. Here is how to make it work (this problem has been fixed in esd 0.2.19)

HINT:
Ok, I was having werido problems with esd, but with recompiling 20 times
(really) I got it!  At least it works, I'm not sure why it works and
would like to hear opinions.  I did this on esound-0.2.18.

./configure --enable-shared=no
make
make install

The strange part is on my original distro (Mandrkae 7) they use shared
and it works fine.  Anyways, it's rockin.
