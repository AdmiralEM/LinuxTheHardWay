TITLE:		Midnight Commander
LFS VERSION:	any
AUTHOR:		Lee Harris <mr.1ee@ntlworld.com>

SYNOPSIS:
	The release version (4.1.36) of Midnight Commander (mc) fails to compile giving an error : mountlist.c:105: parse error before `__extension__'

HINT:
The beta versions of mc are supposed to have fixed this but the link on the 
official download page has been broken every time I've checked.

Update
You can find the beta's here (thanks to Andreas Huebner for pointing this out) 
ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/mc

I'll still leave the instructions on compiling version 4.1.36 though it looks 
as if all development has stopped on the 4.1.xx line and it would probably be 
better to consider using the beta's.

The way i fixed the release version was simply to comment out the
offending line.

In mountlist.c find 

char *strstr (const char *haystack, const char *needle);

and comment it out ie :

/*char *strstr (const char *haystack, const char *needle);*/

The function strstr is already exists in the string library I've since 
discovered

mc should compile ok now.
