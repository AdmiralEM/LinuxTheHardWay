TITLE:		Xconsole
LFS VERSION:	Any if X is installed.
AUTHOR:		ktb <x.y.f@home.com>


SYNOPSIS:
	Xconsole is included with X.  It's used to monitor system console
	messages on the desktop.  This is one way to set it up.


HINT:
The first thing to do is create a named pipe to send the Sysklogd
information xconsole will display.

	# mkfifo /dev/xconsole
	# chgrp tty /dev/xconsole
	# chmod 644 /dev/xconsole
	
Permissions should be as follows.

	$ ls -l /dev/xconsole
	prw-r--r--	1 root	tty 	0 Aug 19 13:07	/dev/xconsole

The next step is to edit /etc/syslog.conf to set what you want outputted 
to /dev/xconsole.  I like to dump everything with a priority of alert or 
higher, so I add the following line.

	*.*	|/dev/xconsole

To make the change take effect restart Sysklogd. 

	# /etc/init.d/sysklogd restart

Last but not least we need to fire up xconsole itself.

	$ xconsole -file /dev/xconsole

If you aren't happy with the text window space, edit the "XConsole" file 
which is probably in /etc/X11/app-defaults/XConsole.
Set text window to the desired size.  For example:

	*text.width:	900
	*text.height:	100

Xconsole also takes the geometry option so you might end up with a
command similar to the one below, to put in your ~/.xinitrc file.

	xconsole -file /dev/xconsole -geometry +67+640 & 
	
See "man xconsole" for more customizations.
