TITLE:		GTK+ compilation problems
LFS VERSION:	any
AUTHOR:		unknown <unknown>

SYNOPSIS:
	This addresses compilation problems in the 1.2.7 version of GTK+. (ed. note: this problem has been fixed in 1.2.8)

HINT:
One major blunder I think I found was when I tried to compile gtk+1.2.7.
I couldn't first but I found the solution and so here it is:

tar xfz gtk+1.2.7.tar.gz ; rm gtk+1.2.7.tar.gz
cd gtk+1.2.7 ( There is a gdk and a gtk directory in the main direcotory )
Thus: cd gtk 
rm Makefile ; rm Makefile.in
vi Makefile.am
Search for the following lines:

# GTK+ header files that don't get installed
gtk_private_h_sources = @STRIP_BEGIN	\
@STRIP_END@

If you don't put something in there and you try to compile it, you get the
following error message:
 Insufficient number of arguments (0) to function `strip'.  Stop.
So I copied a header file from the gdk directory to the gtk directory and named
it dummy.h
cp gdk.h ../gtk/dummy.h. Put this dummy.h into the Makefile.am - Now it has an
argument, right?-: (don't forget the Tab's!)

# GTK+ header files that don't get installed
gtk_private_h_sources = @STRIP_BEGIN	\
		dummy.h		\
@STRIP_END@
Now you can do in the main directory an automake and compile it. make and make
install. voila.
It took me one whole day to figure this out, so I hope this will be usefull to
you when you get there.
I know it's not the best way, but it worked for me.
