TITLE:		The Which Hint
LFS VERSION:	any
AUTHOR:		Jesse Tie Ten Quee <highos@highos.com>

SYNOPSIS:
	Different ways to install which.

HINT:


There about three different ways to include the program which in your
LFS system.

alias which='type -p'

This will work, allthough give you trouble perhaps with things that need
which that don't spawn a shell so something more like this is in order;

cat >/usr/bin/which
#!/bin/sh
type -p $1
<CTRL-C>
chmod +x /usr/bin/which

This should work fine for all general purposes of which, allthough if
you do want to have the genral which program with man pages, etc. then i
suggest you use the GNU Which (if you do a search on [fm] there are
others)

packages: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/which/which-2.12.tar.gz

Enjoy!
