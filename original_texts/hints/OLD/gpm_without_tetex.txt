TITLE:		gpm without teTex
LFS VERSION:	any
AUTHOR:		Lee Harris <mr.1ee@ntlworld.com>

SYNOPSIS:
	gpm fails to compile without tex being install (which entails installing the rather large teTex).

HINT:
You can compile gpm without the documentation. Then you don't need tex.
You will still get the man pages anyway.

In the top level dir look in Makefile.in for the line :- 
         for i in doc sample ; do \  

delete the word doc and save

Do 
         ./configure;make;make install

Then
         cp doc/gpm.8 /usr/share/man/man8/gpm.8
         cp doc/gpm-root.1 /usr/share/man/man1/gpm-root.1
