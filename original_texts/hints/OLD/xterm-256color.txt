TITLE:		256 color xterm

AUTHOR:		Randy Hron <rwhron@earthlink.net>

SYNOPSIS:
	How to build a 256 color capable xterm.

HINT:
	XFree86 builds a 16 color capable xterm by default.
If you want to run vim or other color capable programs, you may
want an xterm that does more colors.

This hint assumes you've already installed XFree86.  Check out
the x11.txt hint if you haven't.  If you've already graduated to
KDE, GNOME, Eterm or "the console", you may not need this either.

1. How many colors do I have?
You can check how many colors your xterm knows with the command:

strings /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm | grep ^color[0-9] | sort -tr +1 -n

This command has to be executed as root, since xterm is setuid
and is not readable by normal users.  It may print something like:

color0
color1
..
color14
color15

If that is all you get, you have a 16 color xterm.  If the list keeps
going to color255, you already have a 256 color xterm.

2. Building a 256 color xterm
If you already removed your xc tree, don't despair.  You can recompile
xterm without compiling the World.  The xterm program is in the first 
XFree86 tarball, X410src-1.tgz.  You won't need tarball 2 or 3 for this
hint.  Here are the steps after you extract the tarball:

cd xc/programs/xterm &&
xmkmf &&
sed 's/_WIDE_CHARS/_WIDE_CHARS -DOPT_256_COLORS -DDFT_TERM_TYPE=linux/' \
	Makefile > Makefile~ &&
mv Makefile~ Makefile &&
make &&
strings xterm | grep ^color[0-9] | sort -tr +1 -n

This time you should see a list of colors that counts to color255

color0
color1
..
color254
color255

4) Install the new xterm
make install

5) Use linux as your TERM variable
Amazingly TERM=linux gives better colors than TERM=xterm-256color.  
This may already set if your /etc/inittab has entries like:

1:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty tty1  38400 linux
	
6) Xdefaults
Different X apps/window managers may use either .Xresources or .Xdefaults
to change their default behavior.  Here are some things in my .Xdefaults
to make colors more enjoyable:

! Pick your favorites from /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt
! Be sure to use the "OneWord" value for a color, and not
! the "two words" value.  
! xterm*background:       black
! xterm*foreground:       green
*loginShell:            true

! Use color for underline attribute
*VT100*colorULMode: on
*VT100*underLine: off

! Use color for the bold attribute
*VT100*colorBDMode: on

! Love scrollback
*VT100*saveLines: 5000
*VT100*scrollBar: true

! Use -color app-defaults in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults
*customization: -color

Make your new ~/.Xdefaults take effect without restarting X with:
xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults


7) Vim
To have syntax highlighting in vim, have this in your ~/.vimrc:

syntax on

8) Log all the way out and come back in.  
You can do a combination of xrdb and sourcing your .bash_profile,
but your window manager will still think your TERM is xterm and
not linux.  To eliminate confusion, just log out to xdm
or the login prompt and come back in.

9) Checking colors
There are several nifty xterm tests in xc/programs/xterm/vttests.  
The fastest one for testing colors is 256colors2.pl.  Just run:

/256colors2.pl

10) Testing vim colors
Vim has a colortest program that you run with vim:

vim /usr/share/vim/vim58/syntax/colortest.vim

>From inside vim, type:
:source %

I counted about 22 colors in this test, but it's nice seeing
the words associated with the colors.

11) Have fun.  Let me know if something here is inaccurate or
could be better.

12) Thanks to Gerard and everyone at Linux From Scratch.

13) William S Gahr mentioned you can set TERM when you start
xterm with "xterm -tn linux".
