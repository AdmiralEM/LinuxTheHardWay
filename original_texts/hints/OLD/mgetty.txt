TITLE:		How to install mgetty+sendfax from sources

LFS-VERSION:	All

AUTHOR:		Edgar Alwers  <edgaralwers@gmx.de>

SYNOPSIS:

	Compilation and Installation of mgetty+sendfax from the sources. 
	Faxes may be sent direct from the PC running "faxspool" and then  "faxrunq". 	
	Documents may be queed  from the editor (e.g. StarOffice ) to the fax-queue
	and then sent with "faxrunq"


HINT:
	Download:
	
	mgetty1.1.28-Jan10.tar.gz
	ftp://alpha.greenie.net/pub/mgetty/source/1.1

	Netpbm (image manipulation/conversion graphics utilities ) netpbm-10.8.tgz 	
	August 16th 2002
	http://download.sourceforge.net/netpbm

	ESPG Ghostscript  espgs-7.05.5-source.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.easysw.com/pub/ghostscript

Installing espgs:
	
	Untar 

		tar xvjf espgs-7.05.5-source.tar.bz2
	and change to the espgs-7.05.5 directory
		cd espgs-7.05.5
Read the INSTALL file and run configure accordingly:	
	./configure --disable-OMNI
Then run 
	make 
	make install. 

You  may also need to download the ghostscript fonts. Get them from
	http://download.sourceforge.net/gs-fonts
and download ghostscript-fonts-std-6.0.tar.gz to the directory  	
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/ghostscript
	Untar 
		tar xvzf ghostscript-fonts-std-6.0.tar.gz

Installing netpbm:

Although faxspool will only need the text to pixel converter pbmtext, we need to 


compile and install netpbm. We do it in a shorter form, using static linked 
libraries 
	
Untar the file with
		tar xvzf netpbm-10.8.tgz
	and change to the netpbm-10.8 directory
		cd netpbm-10.8

run the configure file:
	./configure
and answer the questions as follows:
		platform:			gnu
		regular or merge build	merge
		libnetpbm			static
		TIFF library			libtiff.so
		TIFF header directory	/usr/local/include
		JPEG library			libjpeg.a
		JPEG header directory	/usr/local/include
		PNG library			libpng.so
		PNG header directory	/usr/local/include

		Z library			libz.so
		Z header directory		/usr/include
You may change the resulting Makefile.config, if necessary. Now run 
	make 
	make package
Make package installs the netpbm package in /tmp/netpbm. Run
	./installnetpbm
and answer the questions as follows:
		package directory		/tmp/netpbm
		install prefix			/usr/local/netpbm
		program directory		/usr/local/netpbm/bin
		static library directory	/usr/local/netpbm/lib
		header directory		/usr/local/netpbm/include
		man pages			/usr/local/netpbm/man
Accept the creation of the Symlink /usr/man/web -> /usr/local/netpbm/man/web
	ln -s /usr/local/netpbm/man/web/netpbm.url /usr/man/web/netpbm.url

You will need to include the new directory /usr/local/netpbm/bin in your path:
(e.g. /.bash_profile )
	export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/netpbm/bin

Installing mgetty:

	Untar
		tar xvzf mgetty1.1.28-Jan10.tar.gz
	and change to the directory  mgetty-1.1.28:
		cd mgetty-1.1.28
Copy the file „policy.h-dist“ to „policy.h“:
		cp policy.h.dist policy.h
Edit the Makefile and change line 172 from 
		INSTALL=install -c -o bin -g bin
to
		INSTALL=install -c -o root -g root
edit the next lines according to your needs or accept the Makefile propositions 
and then run make and make install.
Change to the directory  /usr/local/etc/mgetty+sendfax:
		cd /usr/local/etc/mgetty+sendfax
and edit the file sendfax.config. Change the line 'which devices to use for 
outgoing faxes' from 
'fax-devices tty4c:tty4d' to 
'fax-devices ttyS0:ttyS2' 
and the line 'which fax number to transmit to the receiving station' from
'fax-id 49 115 xxxxxxxx' into your own fax line number. Edit the Dial-prefix 
line  e.g. in
		dial-prefix ATDT. 

Uncomment the line 'port ttyS0', if this is the port of your modem.
You might need also a modem initialisation string. I inserted
		modem-init ATS7=255
You might edit the file „faxheader“ in the same directory.
Finally, you should create and edit a file „fax.allow“ or „fax.deny“ in the same 


directory, in order to allow access control to other users than root.
 
Testing faxspool:

You are now ready to run a first test with faxspool. Write with your prefered 
editor ( vi ?) a file 'test.txt' and then run ( as user )


	faxspool    123456 /your/directory/test.txt

where „123456“ stands for the telefon number of a fax receiver.
You can have a look at the fax file in the converted g3 format with the fax 
viewer 
Kfax of the kde system. The fax image is stored in /var/spool/fax/outgoing

Fax spooling from StarOffice:

Open 'printer setup' in StarOffice's main frame, choose 'generic printer' from 
the printer drivers list and add it as a new printer. Rename it to 'fax printer' 


and connect it to the fax_queue=FAX, which is one of the StarOffice existing 
queues  

You don't need to configure, as the fax command format is exactly the one needed 


by faxspool. Print a job to the fax printer, and a pop window will come up, 
asking for the fax number. Thats all.

Sending Faxes:

run -as root - „faxrunq“
