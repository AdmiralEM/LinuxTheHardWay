TITLE:		Setting up dosemu with freeDOS or any other dos
LFS VERSION:	any
AUTHOR:		Alex Kloss <l.x.@gmx.de>

SYNOPSIS:
	Sometimes you want to use the good old Disk Operating System,
	e.g. for playing some real old games (like commander keen), but
	you don't want to shutdown your linux box and don't have a DOS
	bootdisk anyway...

HINT:	
	Get dosemu (and freeDOS) now!

DOWNLOADS:
	http://www.dosemu.org
	dosemu-<version>.tgz; dosemu-freedos-bin.tgz

INSTALL:
	dosemu:

	First edit the compiletime-settings to match your preferences.
	The file compiletime-settings.help explains the usage of these
	options. I myself used the following options:

	--snip
	config {
	  experimental on
	  sbemu on
	  mitshm on
	  x on
	  net on
	  dodebug on
	  slangforce on
	  oldslang off
	  runasroot off
	  linkstatic off
	  newint on
	  aspi on
	}
	--snap

	./rebuild all &&
	cp bin/* <wanted prefix, e.g. /usr/bin> &&
	mkdir /var/lib/dosemu /var/lib/dosemu/dosemu &&
	cp src/plugin/commands/*.com /var/lib/dosemu/dosemu

	now try "dos" or "xdos". If xdos complains about not finding
	the necessary fonts, you should edit your etc/X11/XftConfig
	and add to the first lines

	dir "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc"

	and restart X.

	A minor problem is that the src/plugin/commands dir does not
	contain all of the dosemu stuff, for example the cdrom.sys
	driver is missing. You'll find the turbo C sources in
	/src/commands. Since you propably don't have turbo C, you'll
	have to find a way to 1. extract that driver from the binary
	distribution or 2. compile it without turbo C:

	cd src/commands &&
	for i in aspi cdrom ems emufs; do
	  as86 -b ${i}.sys ${i}.S
	done &&
	cp *.sys /var/lib/dosemu/dosemu

	Just don't mind the errors. The drivers should work anyway.


	freedos:

	mkdir /var/lib/dosemu &&
	cd /var/lib/dosemu &&
	tar xzfv /<wherever it is>/freedos-bin.tar.gz


	any other dos:

	mkdir /var/lib/dosemu /var/lib/dosemu/dos &&
	cp /<wherever it is>/io.sys /var/lib/dosemu &&
	cp /<wherever it is>/msdos.sys /var/lib/dosemu &&
	cp /<wherever it is>/command.com /var/lib/dosemu

	You may be interested in copying other files you want (himem.sys)
	to the dos directory.

CONFIGURE:
	Copy etc/dosemu.users.[easy|secure] and etc/dosemu.conf to /etc and 
	edit them to match your preferences.

TODO:
	Check for other DOS, e.g. Caldera Open Dos, which is also free.

Hope this was helpful!
