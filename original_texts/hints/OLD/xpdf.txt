TITLE:		Setting up and configure xpdf
LFS VERSION:	any
AUTHOR:		Alex Kloss <l.x.@gmx.de>

SYNOPSIS:
	xpdf is a free and fast replacement for the Acrobat Reader,
	featuring some very useful utils (like pdftotext

HINT:	
	Pine is one of the most userfriendly mail reading/sending
	utilities. 

DOWNLOADS:
	ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/ or
	http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html
	-> xpdf-<version>.tar.gz
	optional: t1lib-<version>.tar.gz and freetype-<version>.tar.gz
	The t1lib is only to render Type 1 fonts (not really necessary),
	while freetype2 is usually already installed with XFree86.

INSTALL:
	Since Freetype2 is usually already installed with XFree86, here
	are no separate instructions how to install this package.
	You don't need to install t1lib either to use xpdf, but you can
	have antialiased Type1 fonts with it (which is extremely cool),
	so you may want to install it anyway.

	t1lib:
	======
	
	./configure --prefix=/usr/X11R6 &&
	make [without_doc*] &&
	make install
	
	*: if you don't have LaTeX or want the documentation, otherwise
	simply use "make"

	
	xpdf:
	=====

	 ./configure --prefix=/usr/X11R6 --enable-a4-paper \
	--with-freetype2-includes=/usr/X11R6/include/freetype2 \
	--with-freetype2-library=/usr/X11R6/lib --with-gzip \
	--with-appdef-dir=/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/ &&
	make &&
	make install


CONFIGURATION:
	Copy the sample configuration file:

	cp doc/sample-xpdfrc ~/.xpdfrc

	and edit the file to match your needs. Everything is commented
	out, so you should at least choose your favourite browser and
	whatever font replacements are necessary on your system (and
	maybe you want antialiasing, too - both settings are on the
	bottom of the file).


Hope this was helpful!
