TITLE:		Installing Microcode Update Utility
LFS VERSION:	lfs-3.0-cr2
AUTHOR:		Berkem Dincman berkemdin@ixir.com
SYNOPSIS:	Microcode updates Intel processors at boot.

HINT:
I tried to install the microcode utility on my
lfs-3.0-cr2 brandnew installation.

First I followed the instructions on the
linux/Documentation/Changes file with respect to the
microcode utility, in order to create /dev/cpu ...
and creating an entry in /etc/modules.conf ...

After compiling and installing microcode utility
I made some changes to /etc/init.d/microcode_ctl :
First try to determine the version number of the lfs
installation by looking at /etc/lfs... and
interchanging the phrase redhat-version with <lfs-version>
in the section that checks for the distribution,
in the same section correcting /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions
to /etc/init.d/functions.
Plus erasing the START= daemon ,leaving only
START=

Finally I created symlinks in rcx.d directories
  rc2-5 S800microcode
  rc0,1,6 K200microcode

Now it updates microcode at each boot, nice!
Suggestions are welcome, especially with respect to the symlinks...
