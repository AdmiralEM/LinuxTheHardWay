SYNOPSIS:
	This hint tells you how to synchronize the time across a network.

HINT:
> On a different note, do you know anything about syncing time across the
> network with Win9X machines??
>

setup samba on the linux box..
run "net time \\linuxserver /set /yes" (i'm pretty sure that is the right
syntax)
perhaps from the netlogon script or just in a batch file to be ran on
bootup, on the win9x machines, this will also work for the winNT
machines, the net command might be a little different.. and in winNT
not everyone can set the system time by default, so if it is ran at logon
you might need to give the user the access to change the system time..
... and this way you dont have to install any more software that could
crap your M$ boxes....
