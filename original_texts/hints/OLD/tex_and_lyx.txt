TITLE:		Installation of TeX and LyX
LFS VERSION:	2.3.2 or better.	
AUTHOR:		Arthur H. Johnson II <arthur@linuxbox.nu>

SYNOPSIS:
	How to install TeX from source.  

HINT:
TeX can be almost trivial to install, once you have the right sources.  However
if you get the wrong sources, you will chase your tail for hours.  

We will be using the texk source from the TeX users group.  First, download the
following packages:

1 PACKAGES
==========

a. Required from ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/:

texk-7.2b.tar.bz2	An all-in-one source package for web2c plus the
			various drivers.  Does need the library packages.

texmflib-7.8.tar.bz2	A basic set of TFM's and other input files,
			arranged in Web2c's default installation hierarchy.


b. Required from ftp://ncmir.ucsd.edu/pub/xforms/linux-i386/elf/:

bxform-089-glibc2.1.tar.bz2	This is the toolkit in which LyX is built on. 



c. Required from ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/:

lyx-1.1.6fix4.tar.bz2	This is the latest LyX at the time of writing.  This is
			a front-end to the TeX typesetting system.  Actually,
			its a front-end to LaTeX which is a front-end to TeX.
			It is not actually required for TeX or LaTeX.


d. Optional from ftp://tug.ctan.org/pub/tex/fonts:

You may want more than the fonts included with your texmflib distribution.  You
can find more here.



2 COMPILING AND INSTALLING TEX
==============================


a. Install the texmflib package into /usr/share:

cd /usr/share
tar jxvf /path/to/packages/texmflib-7.8.tar.bz2

This will add the support files to your already existing texmf directory
structure.


b.  Using the texk-7.2b.tar.bz2, compile and install TeX onto your system by
issueing the following commands:

./configure --prefix=/usr/ --datadir=/usr/share/
make 
make install



3 COMPILING AND INSTALLING LYX
==============================

a. Install XForms with the following commands:

make 
make install


b. Install LyX with the following commands:  

./configure --prefix=/usr/X11R6
make
make install



4 TEX WITH LFS AND OTHER PACKAGES
=================================

Some packages, most noteably gcc, will not compile on a system containing TeX.
There is a quick workaround for this however.  Move /usr/bin/texconfig to
/usr/bin/texconfig.lfs before you build your packages.  

If you use a set of scripts, or ALFS, to build LFS, one technique to do
this automatically would be an if loop in your LFS build:

if [ -f /usr/bin/texconfig ]; then
        mv /usr/bin/texconfig /usr/bin/texconfig.lfs;
fi

<build LFS or other packages, including ALFS based systems>

if [ -f /usr/bin/texconfig.lfs ]; then
        mv /usr/bin/texconfig.lfs /usr/bin/texconfig;
fi

This way texconfig will be restored to its origional state when you are done
building.


5 CHANGELOG
