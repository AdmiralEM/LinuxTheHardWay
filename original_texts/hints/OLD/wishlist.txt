This is a list of hints that have been requested by many people. If you have 
time to spare and wish to contribute to LFS in some way, you could write one 
of those:

*  Finish writing the newbie hint.
   The book is now so good that a lot of newbies succeed at building 
   an LFS system, and don't realize all the knowledge they have missed 
   just copying-pasting commands.

*  Write package manager hint that uses a simple script to do the work 
   (ie: find before installation, find after installation, 
   diff the two output files and that diff contains the files 
   installed by that package. Using constructions with cat
   rm and xargs that file can be parsed and a package can be uninstalled.)

*  Guidelines on how to setup a router/firewall.

*  A DSL-Router hint.

*  mca: An all-in-one MTA hint?

*  Feztaa: get some games running.

*  Declan: An /etc/modules.conf hint.

*  Declan: X Configuration and video modes.

*  Declan: A lazy mail set up for standalone
   pc with dial up access.

*  Declan: A kernel options hint.

*  Raphael: Xmms

*  Raphael: Galeon

*  Raphael: Syphleed

*  Raphael: Xchat

*  Raphael: GIMP

*  Raphael: GQView

*  Cowart: "Can someone write a hint on how to set up a time
   sever?"
