GENERAL OUTLINE
===============

TITLE:		GNOME
LFS VERSION:	Latest 3.0-preX (gcc 3.0 will NOT work)
AUTHOR:		roryo and mca <gnomeATlinuxfromscratchDOTorg>

SYNOPSIS:
	From LFS to gnucash.

HINT:

First things first
==================

The developers of the assorted gnome applications are churning new releases 
out at a rate for about 10 per week, it is therefore recommended that you get
the latest version of this hint and the new patches.  These are available via
anonymous CVS at roryo.dynup.net.

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@roryo.dynup.net:/home/cvsroot login

Press <return> at the password prompt.

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@roryo.dynup.net:/home/cvsroot co gnome-hint

This hint has proven quite stable for us, but your mileage will vary.  Consider
this hint somewhat pre-alpha for now.  By using this hint, you agree to
provide us with any and all information concerning build failures, runtime
failures, and/or any other "feedback" you feel we need.  We want to know.  You
can either email us at the address above or find us on irc.linuxfromscratch.org,
whichever you prefer.

We have created a wget list for all of the packages covered in this hint.  It
is available at http://www2.linuxfromscratch.org/gnome/wget.list and is quite
current (well, usually).  Save this list wherever you want, cd into the
directory you'd like to save these packages, and run the following:

    wget -ci /path/to/wget.list

Now sit and wait.  ;)

The URLs are listed in the order they appear in this hint, so you should be
able to start compiling as soon as the first file finishes.


Pre-build instructions
**********************

    The build instructions (and a few of the patches) in this hint rely on the
    following procedures.  This is not optional.

    $GNOME_ROOT, the prefix in which gnome will be installed, is completely up
    to you.

      (this assumes you are using bash/sh)

      export GNOME_ROOT=/opt/GNOME
      export PATH=$PATH:$GNOME_ROOT/bin
      echo $GNOME_ROOT/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf

      export GNOME_OPTS="--prefix=$GNOME_ROOT --with-gnu-ld --disable-static"
      alias gcfg='./configure $GNOME_OPTS'

    If you wish, you can add --disable-nls to the above $GNOME_OPTS.  This will
    prevent the international messages (.po files) from being installed, and will
    save quite a bit of space.  Some packages' configure script will fail with an
    error about not finding intl/libgettext.h.  If so, apply the intl.diff
    included in the patch tarball.

    Assuming you used the wget list, you should have a patches-GNOME.tar.bz2.
    If not, grab it from:
        http://www2.linuxfromscratch.org/gnome/patches-GNOME.tar.bz2

    Unpack (tar yxvf) this file and it will create a patches/ directory.  In
    this directory, the patches are named <package>-<version>.diff.  They are
    probably quite version specific.  The *.wtf files are brief explanations
    of what and why the patch was needed.

    To apply:
        unpack <package>-<version>.tar.gz
        patch -p0 -i /path/to/<package>-<version>.diff

    These patches are created from outside the source tree, so you may have to
    play with -p options depending on where you are.



Miscellaneous Notes
===================

    * New packages

        If a new version of any package in this hint is available, please use
        it.  We will attempt to keep this hint as current as possible, but we
        may fail.  If a new package is available and is causing problems, we
        will make a note of it.  Also, if you don't mind, drop us an email
        about the new package, and whether or not our build instructions were
        ok with it.

        WARNING:  They are leaking a few pre-2.0-alpha packages, most notably
                  control-center.  We are not using these yet as they rely on
                  unstable glib/gtk+ versions.  Anything requiring pkg-config
                  should be ignored for now.

    * FHS Compliance

        This hint is entirely (?) FHS (www.pathname.com/fhs/) compliant.
        You are by no means bound to these instructions, but we cannot
        guarantee the same results if you do stray.

        GNOME is quite large and scattered.  Choosing /usr as the
        $GNOME_PREFIX above will be a very messy decision.

    * Compiler Optimizations

        If you don't know what these are, you'll be better off ignoring this.
        The large majority of these packages will honor the $CFLAGS variable.
        Those that don't (off the top of my head) are libpng, openssl, libdb,
        and python.  There were some others, but they had to be patched for
        other reasons so that 'feature' was added.  If you have problems with
        any packages at runtime, please recompile it without *any*
        optimizations before telling us about it.

    * Symlinks

        These symlinks are here to provide other applications easy access to
        the package's libraries and headers.  This saves us (and you) much
        time and effort in hacking Makefiles and such in an attempt to find
        them.  If you don't follow the symlinking instructions, you are on
        your own with the detection of these packages by others.

    * Objective C

        Several GNOME packages/applications can make use of the objective C
        compiler, if available.  Some packages will fail if you don't install
        the proper packages to make use of it, others will fail because you
        don't have it.  It is not required in any way.

        To install the objc compiler, follow the directions for GCC in the
        shared section of the LFS book (chapter 6, as of 3.0).  Make the
        following change:
            Instead of:  --enable-languages=c,c++
            Use:  --enable-languages=c,c++,objc

        Install gcc per the instructions and continue your quest.

    * TODO - Known bugs/issues

        *  Add dependency notes.  GnuCash is a good example.  If you wish to
           skip it, you can skip at least three other packages too.

        *  The default session is ugly.  We (or someone) need to replace it
           with something better.

        *  We need to create a list of what you miss out on by not having an
           objc compiler.

        *  Rid of the MISSING's.

        *  Esound is a piece of crap and needs rewritten/replaced.

        make all install

    NOTE:  If you don't like the above prefix, feel free to change it.  glib
           has nothing to do with X, and probably doesn't belong where we put
           it.  Everything that depends upon it will have no trouble locating
           it as long as it's prefix/bin is in your $PATH, and the prefix/lib
           is in your /etc/ld.so.conf.

GTK+:
    The Gimp Toolkit.. an X11 widget library.
        ./configure \

    The xml library.
        ./configure \
          --prefix=/usr/X11R6 \

          --with-readline=/usr \
          --with-buffers
        make all install

        mv jpeg-6b jpeg
        ln -s src/unix-gcc.mak Makefile
        make 
        make install

    If you are using glibc 2.2.2 or higher, this build will fail.  Edit
    src/time_.h, insert #include <time.h> on line 35.

GhostScript Fonts:

    This will create the fonts directory, there are other GhostScript fonts available if
    you feel so inclined.

ImageMagick:
    Provides many useful image manipulation functions, plus a few handy
    executables.
        sed \

          --without-perl \
          --with-ttf-fontpath=/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType
        make all install

    NOTE: if you have the TrueType fonts installed in a different
	      path you will have to changes the --with--ttf-fontpath.

imlib:
    Library providing access to all of the above image formats.
        ./configure \
          --prefix=/usr/X11R6 \

    * xmms - if you dont know what it is, when we give up ;)
    * Pharmacy - Gnome CVS front end
    * Gimp - the root of it all, graphics app, total ownage
    * EOG - Eye of Gnome.. an image viewer

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

    Q:  How do I properly start gnome?
    A:  You do one of the following:
            echo gnome-session > ~/.xinitrc
        or, if you wish to enable those annoying little sounds,
            echo gnome-session --enable-sound > ~/.xinitrc

    Q:  I'm trying to build packageXXX from CVS sources, or just regenerate
        its configure script from configure.in, but autoconf bitches about not
        having some other gnome package installed.  WTF?
    A:  Autoconf is dumb and can/will only use one search directory for the
        .m4 files these packages install.  You should probably do the
        following:

            mv $GNOME_PREFIX/share/aclocal/* /usr/share/aclocal/ &&
            rm -r $GNOME_PREFIX/share/aclocal && cd $GNOME_PREFIX/share &&
            ln -s /usr/share/aclocal

    Q:  Am I stupid?
    A:  Obviously, yes.
