1. Introduction.
================

This hint was born while i tryed to search for the euro on my lfs system.
It is more simple than i tought it would be. But in some apps i still dont know
how to get things done like opera. If you have valuable information you can
mail me and i can put it in this hint.



2. Get euro's on a virtual console (tty[1-6]) 
=============================================

First the keyboard map has to be known.
Put this in /etc/sysconfig/keyboard

LAYOUT=/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/include/euro1.map.gz


Than use a latin 9 character set:
vi /etc/sysconfig/font

---<snip>---
# Begin /etc/sysconfig/font

FONTMAP=/usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/lat9u-08.psfu.gz

# End /etc/sysconfig/font
---</snip>---


To let this be your default font, put this at the end in /etc/init.d/loadkeys

---<snip>---
echo -n "Loading font..."
/usr/bin/setfont $FONTMAP 2>/dev/null
evaluate_retval
---<snip>---


What you've basicly have done is: 

loadkeys euro1 &&
setfont /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/lat9u-08.psfu.gz


So open an editor, and test it by pressing <alt gr> e
this is the alt key right of the spacebar.

Or say:

printf "\xa4\n"

Example: ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤

There suposed to be 8 eurosigns above.


And an other trick is to type:
   <ctrl> v
to say 'here comes a special char', and than:
   <alt gr> <shift> 4

It gives \224 as one escaped character.
   
Like in:

echo "This is the \244"

To get this:

This is the ¤



3. To get euro's in an xterm.
=============================

First see what you have that you can use:

xlsfonts | grep iso8859-15

Than pick one you like and put in .Xdefaults

*VT100.font: -misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--0-0-75-75-c-0-iso8859-15

and put in .xinitrc before anything else is executed

xmodmap -e 'keycode 26 = e E EuroSign'


Oke fire up your X and xterm and start an editor and for example vi.
I had to push <shift> <alt gr> 4 to get one.

or type this on your xterm:

printf "\xa4\n"

And again to test it, here some euro's: ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ 




4. Other Issues.
================

For all other apps try to let them use a latin 9 (iso8859-15) character set.

Try to experiment:

grep -irn iso8859 /etc/
grep -irn font /etc/

and change iso8859-1 in iso8859-15 ( AND MAKE BACKUPS FIRST !!! ) 

There still a few things unclear to me, like to get them in webpages, so that
everyone can see them. The best solution I now use is having a little 
gif/png/jpg instead so every one can see what currency i mean. The real solution
is that you use ;euro& as an escaped html character to render an euro.
If you apsolutely dont know what to do any more you can always put EUR before 
a price and that should be oke too.

Opera have let me down, well i think it shal be fixed in the next versions ;)
Gvim too altough vi is working properly.

And then there is the issue that some people want to use there own language.
So as Marco Rinck (marco@romulus23.de) states in his email,

export LC_ALL LC_CTYPE RC_LANG

Well you are free to do that but personaly dont like responses in dutch from my
computer ;) 

To get realy into the locale things here are some things that might get you running
locale --help

give all availeble locales
locale -v -a

give all availeble charmaps
locale -m 

man 1 localedef

man 5 locale

man 5 charmap

man 7 iso_8859-15   

To close this hint i like to say that you are free to ask me how to do stuff and
if you have any usefull additions i like too put them up here. Thanks goes to 
everyone that helped me on #lfs.
