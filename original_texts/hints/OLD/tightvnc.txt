Introduction to tightvnc

Download location	http://osdn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/vnc-tight
Version used		1.2.6

VNC (an abbreviation for Virtual Network Computing) is a great client/server
software package allowing remote network access to graphical desktops. With
VNC, you can access your machine from everywhere provided that your machine
is connected to the Internet.

Installation of tightvnc

Install tightvnc by running the following commands:

        	xmkmf
        	make World
        	cd Xvnc 
		/configure
        	make -s
        	./vncinstall /usr/vnc/bin /usr/vnc/man
        	mkdir /usr/vnc/classes
        	cp classes/* /usr/vnc/classes

Configuring kdm

Important NOTE:: Files may be in a different location. It depends on your 
installation.

Config files

/etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config

Comment out the entry "DisplayManager.requestPort: 0" by adding a !.
The line should look like this "! DisplayManager.requestPort: 0".

/opt/kde3/share/config/kdm

Locate the line XDMCP and change it from false to true.

/etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess

Uncomment out the entry "# * 	#any host can get a login window" by remove the
first #. The line should look like this " * 	#any host can get a login window".

----
Configuring gdm

Important NOTE:: Files may be in a different location. It depends on your
installation.

Config files

/etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config

Comment out the entry "DisplayManager.requestPort: 0" by adding a !.
The line should look like this "! DisplayManager.requestPort: 0".

Run gdm-config

Start gdmconfig. Select Expert Mode. Ensure that Enable XDMCP is 
checked

Locate the line XDMCP and change it from false to true.

/etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess

Uncomment out the entry "# * 	#any host can get a login window" by remove the

Final Step

Reboot the machine. After reboot go to another computer and try the following.
You will need to load the vncviewer on another computer to test. There are clients
for Windows and Unix. The java viewer is not supported under this configuration.

To connect to your server you will need to start the vncviewer. Enter in the IP address
or the FQDN of the service with the last two numbers of the port you want to connect
to. In our suggested installation here is a list of the ports and associated desktop
configurations.

Example:	vnc.server.com:60 
Would connect to vnc.server.com at 640x460 16 bit color
