LFS VERSION:	any GCC3*

SYNOPSIS:	How to get JBuilder8 working using any working Java SDK installed on 
your box
HINT:

I recently recompiled my LFS-System using GCC-3.2.2...if you're reading this, I 
think you know about the issues with SUN's precompiled JDK / JRE. I followed 
Tushar Teredesai's Hint "Compiling Java 2 SDK from Scratch" and had no problems 
so far...but: Borland's JBuilder uses it's own JDK, linked against gcc2 
libraries. To get JBuilder working, do the following:

extract the .tar.gz-file:

tar xvfz /where/JBuilder/is/jb8_linux.tar.gz

install JBuilder using your own Java:

cd jb8_linux/
./per_install.bin LAX_VM $JAVA_HOME/bin/java

(note: JAVA_HOME must be correctly set to your Java 2 SDK homedir)

After installing JBuilder you have to modify a configuration file to tell 
JBuilder not to use its own java:
In JBuilders installation dir, change in file bin/jdk.config the lines javapath 
and addpath according to your Java installation, my jdk.config for example:

---begin jdk.config----

#
# Set the path for the JDK
javapath /opt/java/bin/java
# Add the tools.jar
addpath /opt/java/lib/tools.jar

# Force standard VM settings for all applications
vmparam -Xverify:none

# |    Uncomment the following line if you are having   |
# |  problems with your default file encoding.  This    |
# |    problem is evident in some locales               |
# |                                                     |
# +-----------------------------------------------------+
#vmparam -Dfile.encoding=ISO8859_1


---end jdk.config----
