TITLE:		Xaw3d
LFS VERSION:	any
AUTHOR:		Philipp Niemann <lfshints@azagtoth.de>

SYNOPSIS:
	Installing Xaw3d.

HINT:
Get the source for Xaw3d from:
ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/widgets/Xaw3d/R6.3/
Version this hint used was: Xaw3d-1.5.tar.gz (284420 bytes)

You unpack the tar-archiv in your preferred compile- Directory
and follow the steps:

1. tar xzvf Xaw3d-1.5.tar.gz
2. cd xc/lib/Xaw3d
3. vim +32 XawI18n.h
    Before doing anything else type:
    4dd:w
    :q

    With that you remove the lines

    #include <widec.h>
    #define wcslen(c) wslen(c)
    #define wcscpy(d,s) wscpy(d,s)
    #define wcsncpy(d,s,l) wsncpy(d,s,l)

    from the file.
    The file <widec.h> was not found on my System. I found references to
    it on Google with "wslen" as search. Seems to be some old curses
    stuff. That's my guess. Anyway, with my installed libs I found the
    functions wcslen wcscpy and wcsncpy in /usr/include/wchar.h
    If this hint doesn't work for you check the make-output for
    implicitly declared functions wcslen wcscpy or wcsncpy.

There is an option in the Imakefile which does changes something. Refer
to the README.XAW3D for details. (Change is about Motif look, I think).

4. xmkmf
5. make includes
6. make depend
7. make # Look out for warnings about implicit declarations
    # I did "make > /dev/null" add "| grep impl" if you like
8. su
9. make install
    Things are now installed in /usr/X11R6/include/Xaw3d and
    /usr/X11R6/lib/Xaw3d.so*. Optionally, as libXaw3d.so is linked to
    libXaw3d.so.7.0, you may want to do
9a. ln -sf libXaw3d.so.7.0 /usr/X11R6/lib/libXaw3d.so.7
9b. ln -sf libXaw3d.so.7 /usr/X11R6/lib/libXaw3d.so

10. ldconfig -v
11 exit
+++++++++++++++++++++

That was verified by compiling gv. Looks like it works. I should
have installed ghostscript in the first place, though ;-)
