SYNOPSIS:
	Installing Joe.


HINT:
Very configurable, easy to learn and plenty of features.
I used this for several months until having to press two
buttons to play back macros annoyed me too much.

Download: ftp://ftp.std.com/src/editors/joe2.8.tar.Z

What's a .Z? Who cares, gzip can handle it.
unpack the source then:

sed -e 's@\(WHEREJOE = \).*@\1/usr/bin@'\
    -e 's@\(WHERERC = \).*@\1/etc@'\     
    -e 's@\(WHEREMAN = \).*@\1/usr/share/man/man1@'\
    Makefile >makefile                              
make
make install
