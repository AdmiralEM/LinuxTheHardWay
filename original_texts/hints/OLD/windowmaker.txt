Building WindowMaker:
=====================
Now lets get started with the build of WindowMaker. You don't need
to be a rocket scientist to compile this program. It is strait 
forward. 

Here is the simple build:

./configure
make
make install
ldconfig

=================================================================
Now lets add some options:

./configure --prefix=/opt/wm \
--with-appspath=/opt/wm \
--enable-debug=no &&
make &&
make install

add /opt/wm/lib to the /etc/ld.so.conf file and run ldconfig

--prefix=/opt/wm  

  Installs WM in its own directory. This also lets you remove
  WindowMaker if you don't want it. If you don't like this 
  location pick one of your suiting.

--with-appspath=/opt/wm 

  Makes sure WPrefs.app installs in the right place

--enable-debug=no

  This removes the debuging symbols

==================================================================

One last thing before starting your newly installed Window 
Manager.

Logon as each of your users and switch to their home directory. 
Run the wmaker.inst program to install WindowMakers 
configurations.

Finally your finished. Type startx and  and you should be greeted
with WindowMaker's desktop.
