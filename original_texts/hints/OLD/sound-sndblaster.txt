SYNOPSIS:
	How to install a SB Live!

HINT:
> Installing alsa 0.5.7
> I realized I had no information to create the modules.conf I required

Actually, you don't even need alsa in order to use the Live!.

Just grab the latest source code from
http://opensource.soundblaster.com/snapshot.html, compile and install it, then
run "insmod soundcore && insmod emu10k1", and you have sound!
