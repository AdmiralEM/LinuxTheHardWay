SYNOPSIS:
        How to setup a complete email system.

HINT:
$Revision: 1.1 $

Introduction to Complete Email

This hint will help you configure a complete email system. One that supports
IMAP and POP3 requests. It will also filter SPAM and remove harmfull HTML code
from messages. This is a very long hint, but in order to get everything to work
you must follow all steps.

Assumptions Made in this document

	I have made the following assumptions in this document.
	File have been downloaded.
	The use of tar.
	Openssl is installed. Install information is located in this document also.

---
Important
	
	The complete mail system will not be functional until you have
	completed all the steps. You can skip the steps that are optional,
	without any problems

	DO NOT USE DB 4.1.24 IT DOES NOT WORK WITH THIS CONFIGURATION.

---
Postfix

	Before you can setup Postfix you will need to setup Berkeley DB.

	Setup of Berkeley DB
	
		To Compile Berekely DB you can use the following commands.

		Change to the /usr/src/db-4.014/dist directory
		In the directory issue the following commands

		./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-shared -- enable-compat185
		make docdir=/usr/doc/BerkeleyDB-4 all install

	This completes the Setup of Berkeley DB. You can remove the db-4.0.13 file and directory.

Before Compiling

	Before compiling postfix you will need to create a user and a group.

	In /etc/passwd add : postfix:x:101:101::/dev/null:/bin/false

	In /etc/group add : postfix:x:101: postdrop:x:102:

Compiling

	Change to /sr/src/postfix-1.1.11 directory
	In the directory issue the following commands

	make 

	Now if you have never installed Postfix before the next command you will issue
	is the following command. You may want to look at the configuration information
      below, it may help you answer some of question that postfix will ask you.
	
	make install
	
	If you have installed Postfix before the next command you will issue is the following
	command

	make upgrade

Configuration

	You will need to change postfix's configuration to work with the courier-imap server.
	The configuration below is my working config. I have added *** *** lines where changes are
	needed

	Configuration File Main.cf - /etc/postfix/main.cf

	queue_directory = /var/spool/postfix
	command_directory = /usr/sbin	
	daemon_directory = /usr/libexec/postfix
	mail_owner = postfix
	myhostname = mail.server.com *** Change this to your mail server DNS Name ***
	mydomain = server.com *** Change this to your domain name ***
	myorigin = $mydomain
	inet_interfaces = all
	mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, $mydomain,
		mail.$mydomain, www.$mydomain, ftp.$mydomain
	mynetworks_style = subnet
	mynetworks = 192.168.0.0/24, 127.0.0.0/8 *** Change this to your Network IP -- Do not Change the 127.0.0.0/8 ***
	relayhost = [ smtp.isp.com ]  *** Change this to your ISP's smtp server ***
	allow_percent_hack = yes
	append_at_myorigin = yes
	append_dot_mydomain = yes
	empty_address_recipient = MAILER-DAEMON
	masquerade_classes = envelope_sender, header_sender, header_recipient
	masquerade_domains = server.com *** Change this to your domain name ***
	masquerade_exceptions =
	swap_bangpath = yes
	transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport
	alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/aliases
	alias_database = hash:/etc/postfix/aliases
	home_mailbox = Maildir/
	mail_spool_directory = /var/mail
	mailbox_command = /usr/bin/procmail -d "$USER"
	smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name ($mail_version)
	debug_peer_level = 2
	debugger_command =
	 	PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin
		 xxgdb $daemon_directory/$process_name $process_id & sleep 5
	sendmail_path = /usr/sbin/sendmail
	newaliases_path = /usr/bin/newaliases
	mailq_path = /usr/bin/mailq
	setgid_group = postdrop
	manpage_directory = /usr/share/man
	sample_directory = /etc/postfix/sample
	readme_directory = no
	content_filter = smtp:127.0.0.1:10024
	maps_rbl_reject_code = 571 
	maps_rbl_domains = dynablock.wirehub.net, blackholes.wirehub.net, relays.ordb.org
	smtpd_sender_restrictions = hash:/etc/postfix/access, reject_maps_rbl

	Configuration File Master.cf - /etc/postfix/master.cf

	Use the file that is in /etc/postfix directory and add the following line after smtp

	localhost:smtp-backdoor	 	inet	n	-	n	-	-	smtpd -o content_filter=

	Configuration File Aliases - /etc/postfix/aliases

	You will need to configure the aliases file to your needs, the default should be fine. The
	import thing to remember is after you make changes to this file, you will need to run the
	newaliases command for that file to be in effect. Important note: You will need to create a
	user for the root email account. By using procmail we have disabled the root mail account. I
	suggest the account name of admin. Add the following to your aliases file.

	root: admin

	Configuration File Transport - /etc/postfix/transport

	This file is how every mail is handled by your domain. You will need to change *** *** lines 
	where changes are needed. The import thing to rember is after you make changes to this file,
	you will need to run the postmap /etc/postfix/transport command for that file to be in effect.

	.server.com              local:  *** Change this to your domain name ***
	localhost			local:

	Configuration File Access - /etc/postfix/spam_access_list

	This file I made a cron event. If you have already installed FCRON or another cron program all
	you need to do is run the following script. This file is for a spam protection. At the end of
	this file I have added a fcron and wget instructions. You will need to run this file manually
	one time. This will create the first access file.

	#!/bin/bash

	clear
	cd /tmp
	echo "Getting SPAM Access list..."
	wget http://basic.wirehub.nl/spamlist-extended.txt
	echo "Moving SPAM Access list to Postfix Directory..."
	mv /tmp/spamlist-extended.txt /etc/postfix/access
	echo "Enabling SPAM Access list in Postfix..."
	postmap /etc/postfix/access

	Start-up Script

	#!/bin/bash
	# Begin $rc_base/init.d/postfix

	# Based on sysklogd script from LFS-3.1 and earlier.
	# Rewritten by Gerard Beekmans  - gerard@linuxfromscratch.org

	source /etc/sysconfig/rc
	source $rc_functions

	case "$1" in
		start)
			echo "Starting Postfix..."
			/usr/sbin/postfix start > /dev/null 2>&1
			evaluate_retval
			;;

		stop)
			echo "Stopping Postfix..."
			/usr/sbin/postfix stop > /dev/null 2>&1
			evaluate_retval
			;;

		reload)
			echo "Reloading Posfix..."
			/usr/sbin/postfix reload > /dev/null 2>&1
			evaluate_retval
			;;

		restart)
			$0 stop
			sleep 1
			$0 start
			;;
		*)
			echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|reload|restart}"
			exit 1
			;;
	esac

	# End $rc_base/init.d/postfix

	Runlevels - You will need to select the runlevel you want to run postfix at. Use the
	the following command to achieve this. Change the ?? to the # you want to use.

	ln -sf /etc/rc.d/init.d/postfix /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc0.d/K??postfix
	ln -sf /etc/rc.d/init.d/postfix /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc3.d/S??postfix
	ln -sf /etc/rc.d/init.d/postfix /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc4.d/S??postfix
	ln -sf /etc/rc.d/init.d/postfix /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc5.d/S??postfix
	ln -sf /etc/rc.d/init.d/postfix /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc6.d/K??postfix

---
Procmail
	
	Compiling
	
	You will need to edit the autenticate.c file before compiling. This will make procmail work
	with Maildir style mailboxes.

	Change to the /usr/src/procmail-3.22/src directory

	cp authenticate.c authenticate.c.backup
	sed -e 's|#define MAILSPOOLHOME "/.mail"|#define MAILSPOOLHOME "/Maildir/"|g' \
              authenticate.c.backup > authenticate.c

	Change to the /usr/src/procmail-3.22 directory
	echo "" | make BASENAME=/usr install

	More information will be discussed in the Procmail Recipes section

---
Courier-Imap
	
	Compiling
	
	Change to the /usr/src/courier-imap-1.4.6 directory

	These commands need to be run by a user other than root.

	./configure --prefix=/usr/courier \
                  --sysconfdir=/etc/courier \
                  --with-piddir=/var/run \
                  --with-authshadow \
                  --without-authpam \
			--without-authuserdb \
	            --without-authmysql \
                  --enable-workarounds-for-imap-client-bugs
	make

	These commands need to be run by the root users

	make install
	make install-configure

	Configuration Files
	
	Configuration File - /etc/courier/imapd

	Edit this file. The last line of the file has the following information in it.
	
	IMAPDSTART=NO
	
	Change this to =YES

	If you also want a POP3 server edit - /etc/courier/pop3d

	The last line of the file has the following information in it.

	POP3DSTART=NO

	Change this to =YES

	Configuration File - /etc/courier/authdaemonrc

	Verify that the authmodulelist="authshadow"

	Start-up Scripts

	cp /usr/courier/libexec/imapd.rc /etc/rc.d/init.d/courier-imap
	cp /usr/courier/libexec/pop3d.rc /etc/rc.d/init.d/courier-pop3

	Runlevels - You will need to select the runlevel you want to run courier at. Use the
	the following command to achieve this. Change the ?? to the # you want to use.

	ln -sf /etc/rc.d/init.d/courier-imap /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc0.d/K??courier-imap
	ln -sf /etc/rc.d/init.d/courier-imap /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc3.d/S??courier-imap

Spamassassin and Razor
	
	Change to the /usr/src/razor-agents-2.14 directory

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make -s install

	Change to the /usr/src/Mail-SpamAssassin-2.31 directory

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make -s install

	Configuration File
	
	/etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf file you may need to specify email addresses that
	are exempt from spam checking. Example to allow all emails from joe@isp.com you 
	would add the following line to the local.cf file

	whitelist_from joe@isp.com

---
Creating Maildirs

	I will be using the user admin as the example here. You will need to do this for
	all the users that you want to give mail access to. If you run this command as root
	you will need to change the file permissions to the maildir manually, using the
	following chmod utilizing 700 and chown user.user -R

	Now we are getting to the actual mail directories. First you will need to create
	a default mail directory. 

	maildirmake /home/admin/Maildir

	This will create the main mail directory. Since we are also using spam checking I
	would also create a Spam folder. Type it exactly like this.

	maildirmake /home/admin/Maildir/.Spam

--- 
Procmail Recipes

	The procmail recipe I use will sort the mail, sanitize, and spam check all the emails
	that enter the system. This file will need to be in all of the users home directory.
	Permissions on this file must be set with the chmod utilizing 644.

	.procmailrc

	# Begin /~/.procmailrc
	
	# Prelimiaries
	SHELL=/bin/bash
	MAILDIR=$HOME/Maildir/
	DEFAULT=$MAILDIR
	ORGMAIL=$MAILDIR
	LOGFILE=/var/log/procmailrc.log
	VERBOSE=yes
	LOGABSTRACT=all
	ANOMY=/usr/anomy

	:0:
	* ^From:.*\<*@server.com> # Change server.com to your domain. This will bypass all
	$DEFAULT                  # check if the mail is from the localdomain.

	:0fw
	| /usr/anomy/bin/sanitizer.pl /usr/anomy/anomy.conf

	:0fw
	* < 256000
	| spamassassin

	:0:
	* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
	$MAILDIR.Spam/

	# Accept all the rest to default mailbox
	:0
	$DEFAULT

	# End /~/.procmailrc

	You can also have it sort email that come in from the gotmail and fetchmail script. Here is
	a modified procmailrc file that will sort emails from gotmail and fetchmail. You will have to
	issue an additonal makemaildir command. Here is the command line for the examples I show.

	maildirmake /home/admin/Maildir/.Hotmail
	maildirmake /home/admin/Maildir/.isp
	maildirmake /home/admin/Maildir/.isp2

	After you have made the Maildir directories make sure that the user that owns then is the
	same user that the mail is intended for. In this case

	chown admin.admin /home/admin/Maildir -R
	chmod 700 /home/admin/Maildir -R

	Here is the recipe
	
	# Begin /~/.procmailrc
	
	# Prelimiaries
	SHELL=/bin/bash
	MAILDIR=$HOME/Maildir/
	DEFAULT=$MAILDIR
	ORGMAIL=$MAILDIR
	LOGFILE=/var/log/procmailrc.log
	VERBOSE=yes
	LOGABSTRACT=all
	ANOMY=/usr/anomy

	:0:
	* ^From:.*\<*@server.com> # Change server.com to your domain. This will bypass all
	$DEFAULT                  # check if the mail is from the localdomain.

	:0fw
	| /usr/anomy/bin/sanitizer.pl /usr/anomy/anomy.conf

	:0fw
	* < 256000
	| spamassassin

	:0:
	* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
	$MAILDIR.Spam/

	:0:
	* ^TO_user@hotmail.com
	$MAILDIR.Hotmail/

	:0:
	* ^TO_user@isp.com
	$MAILDIR.isp/
 
	:0:
	* ^TO_user@isp2.com
	$MAILDIR.isp2/

	# Accept all the rest to default mailbox
	:0
	$DEFAULT

	# End /~/.procmailrc

Imap Filter

	This program will allow you to filter IMAP messages like procmail, but that is not why
	I use it. It also allows you to delete emails that are old. The imapfilterrc file must
	chmod with 700 and belong to the user who's home dir it is in.

	Compiling
		
	Change to the /usr/src/imapfilter-0.7.3 directory

	cp Makefile Makefile.org
	sed -e 's|/usr/local|/usr|g' \
		 Makefile.org > Makefile
	make
	make install

	Configuration File

	The only catch to this configuration file is that it requires a username and
	password. It lives in the home directory of the users. This will only delete
	the messages older than 7 days from the Spam folder only. It will not touch
	the INBOX

	###########
	# Options #

Wget

	This will give a basic setup for wget.

	./configure --prefix=/usr \
                  --sysconfdir=/etc/wget
	make
	make install

	Some users may need to change the #passive_ftp = off to passive_ftp = on

---
Nail

	This will give a basic setup for nail. Do to the setup, this is only
	used to send email and not to receive. Nail is not Maildir compatible.
	You can use mutt or pine to read emails from a IMAP folder

	./configure --prefix=/usr \
                  --with-sendmail=/usr/sbin/sendmail
	make
	make install
	ln -sf /usr/bin/nail /usr/bin/mail


---
Fcron

	This will give a basic setup for fcron. Follow the fcron instruction during the fcron
	installation process

Optional program pop-before smtp

	This program allow your remote users to send email from a remote location.
	It allows this by capturing their current IP after they have done a POP or
	IMAP transfer from courier. The IP only stays active for a time that you
	have setup.

	Here is the basic compile and configuration for pop-before-smtp

	make -s
	make -s install
	cd /etc/postfix
	cp pop-before-smtp.conf pop-before-smtp.conf.org
	sed -e 's|grace = 2h|grace = 30m|g' \ 
	    -e 's|log_file = /var/log/mail.log|log_file = /var/log/mail.log|g' \ # Change to your log file 
	    pop-before-smtp.conf.org > pop-before-smtp.conf
	rm -rf pop-before-smtp.conf.org

	Now you will need to configure postfix to use the file	
	
	You will need to edit your main.cf file and add the following line
	smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/pop-before-smtp, check_relay_domains

	Start-up Script

	#!/bin/bash
	# Begin $rc_base/init.d/pop-before-smtp

	# Based on sysklogd script from LFS-3.1 and earlier.
	# Rewritten by Gerard Beekmans  - gerard@linuxfromscratch.org

	source /etc/sysconfig/rc
	source $rc_functions

	case "$1" in
		start)
			echo "Clearing POP Before SMTP File..."
			rm -rf /etc/postfix/pop-before-smtp
			evaluate_retval
			echo "Starting POP Before SMTP..."
			/usr/bin/pop-before-smtp &
			evaluate_retval
			;;

		stop)
			echo "Stopping Pop Before SMTP..."
			killproc /usr/bin/pop-before-smtp
			;;

		restart)
			$0 stop
			sleep 1
			$0 start
			;;

		status)
			statusproc
			;;

		*)
			echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart|status}"
			exit 1
			;;
	esac

	# End $rc_base/init.d/pop-before-smtp


	Runlevels - You will need to select the runlevel you want to run postfix at. Use the
	the following command to achieve this. Change the ?? to the # you want to use.

	ln -sf /etc/rc.d/init.d/pop-before-smtp /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc0.d/K??pop-before-smtp
	ln -sf /etc/rc.d/init.d/pop-before-smtp /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc3.d/S??pop-before-smtp
	ln -sf /etc/rc.d/init.d/pop-before-smtp /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc4.d/S??pop-before-smtp
	ln -sf /etc/rc.d/init.d/pop-before-smtp /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc5.d/S??pop-before-smtp
	ln -sf /etc/rc.d/init.d/pop-before-smtp /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc6.d/K??pop-before-smtp

Notes

	--- Outlook Express ---
	
	If you are using Outlook Express Clients. Here is how you would configure them.
	
	Setup an IMAP account. Follow the prompts until you get a message. Would you like 
	to Download folders from the mail server you added. Click on NO. If you have not
	exited from the account creation screen you can continue to the next step.

	Then go to Tools -=> Accounts -=> Select the Account You just made -=> Properties
	
	Go to the IMAP tab. In the Root folder path type INBOX.

	--- Pine 4.10 or greater ---

	Go to Pine's Main Menu. Select Setup then Configure. Go down to "inbox-path" setting
	set it (hostname) INBOX

	--- Netscape Messenger ---
	
	Uncheck the opton Show only subscribed folders in the Advanced tab.

	Under "Personal Namespace" enter "INBOX."

	--- Shared Folders ---

	If you are using shared folders the same steps apply, but I would create a separate 
	account and using the above information. All you have to do is change INBOX to
	SHARED.

	and the commands to correct them.

	chmod 600 .procmailrc
	chmod 710 .fetchmailrc

	Here are the necssary permissions for unifed logging of all of the 
	programs listed

	chmod 666 /var/log/procmail.log
	chmod 666 /var/log/imapfilter.log
	chmod 666 /var/log/fetchmail.log
