TITLE:		Lynx compilation problems
LFS VERSION:	up until 2.4.4
AUTHOR:		Lee Harris <mr.1ee@ntlworld.com>

SYNOPSIS:
	When you try to compile lynx on systems running glibc version 2.1.3 you may get an error.

HINT:
This is caused because glibc and ncurses both have a symbol Called ERR 
defined in their header files and lynx includes both files while compiling. 
The remedy is quite simple though, as lynx only actually uses the one in the 
ncurses header .

Look in /usr/include/sys/ucontext.h for this :-

                 # define TRAPNO TRAPNO 
                  ERR, 
                 # define ERR    ERR 
                  EIP, 

And comment it out, eg

                 /*# define TRAPNO TRAPNO 
                  ERR, 
                 # define ERR    ERR 
                  EIP, */

Now it should be possible to compile lynx.

Remember to return ucontext.h to its original state after compilation.
