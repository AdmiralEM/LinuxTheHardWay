SYNOPSIS:
	How to add the Enlightenment window manager to your X-configured LFS system.

1. Introduction

This hint describes the process to go through to install the Enlightenment
window manager on a LFS system. It is basically a straight forward install, but
some libraries needed to be made a bit differently than most packages, and some
files are harder to find than others. Also, order is important. Where you see
^OPT^ replace that with the optimizations you want to use. For instance on my
AMD K6-2 machine I use '-O3 -march=k6' without any problems.

2. Packages

These are the packages you will need. All of these sites at least have
anonymouse ftp access, but might not have web access.

3. Installation

Unpack each file in turn, and enter it's directory. First the image libraries
will be built, then imlib, fnlib, and finally Enlightenment itself.

libpng:

run:
cp scripts/makefile.linux makefile

run:
make CFLAGS='^OPT^' CXXFLAGS='^OPT^' &&
make &&
./pngtest &&
make install

libtiff:

If you want the documentation then run:
mkdir /usr/share/html

Edit the configure file. Find DIR_HTML= and change set it to
/usr/share/html/tiff. Find HTML= and set it to yes. Find the line : ${ENVOPTS=}
and add your optimizations after the '='. Find GCOPTS="-g" and remove the -g.
Find DIR_BIN, DIR_LIB, DIR_INC, MANPATH, and DIR_MAN and remove the "local/"
from the directory.

run:
./configure &&
make &&
make install

libjpeg:

run:
./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-static --enable-shared &&
make &&
make install

giflib:

Edit both lib/Makefile and util/Makefile find the uncommented CFLAGS= line
(without the # in front of it), and add your optimizations to that line. Be
sure to remove the -g to keep your code small (it enables debugging).

run:
make &&
make install

libungif:

run:
./configure --prefix=/usr &&
make &&
make install

imlib:

run:
./configure --prefix=/usr &&
make &&
make install

fnlib:

run:
./configure --prefix=/usr &&
make &&
make install

Enlightenment:

run:
./configure --prefix=/usr &&
make &&
make install

Now you need to log in as a normal user. In your home directory edit your
.xinitrc file. If it exists, look for "exec fvwm" as the last line of the file.
Replace that line with exec /usr/enlightenment/bin/enlightenment. If the file
doesn't exist, then just create the file with that one line.

run:
chmod +x .xinitrc
