TTILE:		reiserfs file system
LFS VERSION:	any
AUTHOR:		Florin Boariu <florin@bnv-bamberg.de>

SYNOPSIS:
	"reiserfs is a revolutionary new approach to file system design which stores not just filenames but the files themselves in a B*-tree. It is a generation ahead of alternatives which use older plain B-tree technology, and cannot store the files themselves in the tree. Reiserfs doesn't suffer from log congestion either, you can effectively use it for quickly creating a 100,000 entry directory, and it is fairly unique in that." This hint tells you how to install it.

HINT:
I'm currently using reiserfs, and it works great. All you have to do is
download the reiserfs patch, a fitting kernel version for it (I have
2.2.14), patch the kernel and build it. Boot your "normal" system with the
new kernel (which of course now has both reiserfs and ext2 support) and
mkreiserfs on /dev/whatever-your-lfs-partition. Make a second boot disk
for the lfs partition and... there you are!

I don't know for sure, I have a ext2 partition as my /dev/hda1 which is
about 50 megs large. I'm planing to use that one as my /boot.

I'd guess that it should work, since lilo computes (AFAIK) the exact
location of the raw data (doesn't it?), so it doesn't matter whether it's
reiserfs or ext2. But I might be wrong.
