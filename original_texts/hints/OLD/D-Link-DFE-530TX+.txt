SYNOPSIS:
	How to get a D-Link DFE-530TX+ working.

HINT:
Thought I would share how I got my D-Link DFE-530TX+ working...

The DFE-530TX+ has a different chipset than the DFE-530TX. It's using a
Realtek RTL8139 chipset.

The kernel I am currently using (2.2.14) doesn't have support for this
network card, so I did some web surfing and I foundÿa driver for the
card...

Information about the driver is located
www.scyld.com/network/rtl8139.html

To install the driver for this network card, do the following:

Download the following files from ftp://ftp.scyld.com/pub/network
1. rtl8139.c
2. pci-scan.c
3. pci-scan.h
4. kern-compat.h

Compile pci-scan.c:
gcc -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ -O6 -c pci-scan.c

Compile rtl8139.c:
gcc -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ -O6 -c rtl8139.c

Testing the module:
insmod rtl8139.o

If you get any unresolved symbol errors, try doing 'insmod pci-scan.o'
first...

Installing the modules:
install -m 644 pci-scan.o /lib/modules/<your kernel version>/net/
install -m 644 rtl8139.o /lib/modules/<your kernel version>/net/

-Remember to replace <your kernel version> with the version number of
your kernel, e.g. 2.2.14

Add the line below to your modules.conf (or, in some cases,
conf.modules):
alias eth0 rtl8139

Do a 'depmod' command to update the modules database

Now you should be able to successfully finish step 9 (setting up basic
networking) of the lfs book...

Hope this helps anyone having problems with this network card. I was
getting ready to return it to the store, until i found what driver the
card needed...
