a method to avoid an internet connection when compiling.

ATTACHMENTS: none

PREREQUISITES:
This hint requires that you have sufficient knowledge of LinuxFromScratch.
This hint is applicable only for users that follow the LFS development book
as of the submission date above.

HINT:
   DOWNLOADING DEPENDENCIES
   ------------------------
From the rustc source directory, edit src/stage0.json. Select one dependency
file each of cargo, rustc, and rust-std for your system. Use .xz, not .gz files.
Examples using rustc-1.67.1:

   dist/2023-01-10/cargo-1.66.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz
   dist/2023-01-10/rustc-1.66.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz
   dist/2023-01-10/rust-std-1.66.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz

Download the dependencies from https://static.rust-lang.org to a location of
your choice. Note the yyyy-mm-dd string in the dependency files for later use.
From the examples use 2023-01-10.

   COMPILING
   ---------
From the source directory, mkdir -pv build/cache/2023-01-10 (use above string).
Copy the downloaded dependencies to build/cache/2023-01-10.

Follow the documentation and rustc will compile without an internet connection.
