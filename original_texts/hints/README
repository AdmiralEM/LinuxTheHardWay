The fact that you are reading this file indicates that you are
accessing the archive directly :-) Here is a short map of what
the significance is for the various folders found here.
* HOLD:
    Contains hints that are being integrated into one of the
    official book (LFS/BLFS). Once a stable version of the book
    is released, the hint will be removed from this directory.
* PREVIOUS_FORMAT:
    Contains the hints that have not yet been moved to the new and
    improved format. Once all hints are converted, this directory
    will be removed. Note that hints in this directory do not show
    up on the Online Hints Index.
* OLD:
    Contains hints that are obsolete for one reason or another.
* LICENSES:
    This directory contains various licenses that the hints are under.
* MAINTAINER:
    Scripts and files useful for Maintainers and Authors to verify the
    Hint format.
