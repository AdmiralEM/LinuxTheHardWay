TITLE:		Xawtv
LFS VERSÝON:	lfs-3.0-rc2
AUTHOR:		Berkem Dincman <berkemdin@ixir.com>

SYNOPSIS:
	Adjusting LFS for TV
HINT:

In order to activate the existing support for TV-cards,
two different options in the kernel have to be selected.

Character devices --> I2C Support -->
	activate I2C Support plus
	add at least these two options:
	I2C bit-banging,
	I2C device-interface

Multimedia devices --> turn on Video4Linux

For these modules(compiled in as modules) to be loaded
correctly

cat /usr/src/linux/Documentation/video4linux/bttv/Modules.conf \
>> /etc/modules.conf

and edit

options bttv	card=... pll=... radio=... 
options tuner	type=... debug=1

according to CARDLÝST in documentation, at the same time
we create new devices in /dev with the help of

cp /usr/src/linux/Documentation/video4linux/bttv/MAKEDEV \
/dev/MAKEDEV.bttv && cd /dev && chmod +x MAKEDEV.bttv
./MAKEDEV.bttv

xawtv-3.64 compilation:
If you have XFree 4.0.1 or later try :

./configure --with-xfree-ext --with-xvideo

If it compiles, you have to add 

Load		"v4l"

in the Modules section of your XF86Config file.
If it runs, it should enable you to view TV in higher
resolutions, since X is handling the TV card. Look
also in the Readme of bttv, in order to find out about
support of drivers for X.
