TITLE:		Blackbox-hint
LFS VERSION:	LFS 3.3 (using gcc-3.1)
AUTHOR:		Roy Ens <ens@cs.ttu.edu>

SYNOPSIS:
	How to add and configure Blackbox using various Blackbox tools to your
	personal X configured LFS system.

HINT:

1. Introduction
-------------------------
This hint is going to attempt to show you how to install Blackbox and
eventually how to configure some of it as well. It will also eventually 
have a brief overview of some of the most common Blackbox tools (also known as
bb-tools). Blackbox is very simple to install and does not have any major
library requirements. The hint assumes that you have an LFS system that has
XFree86 installed and configured on it. It will not attempt to show you how to
install and configure X since there is already a good hint on that.

2. What is Blackbox?
-------------------------
For this I'm going to take a quote directly off of the Blackbox homepage
<http://blackboxwm.sourceforge.net>.
	"Blackbox is that fast, light window manager you have been looking for
	 without all those annoying library dependencies. If you have a C++ 
	 compiler and the X Window system you can compile and use it."
So there you have it. There really are no dependencies except those that you
get when you create a LFS system and the XFree86 dependency which is just
common sense.

4. Getting Sources
-------------------------
We are going to use stable versions for this. Even though the beta versions
are very good with only a few bugs.

Blackbox v 0.62.1

5. Installing Blackbox
-------------------------
The installation for Blackbox is quite simple. It's just like all the other
packages you have installed. I like to install Blackbox in /usr because it
doesn't create a whole lot of files and therefore I have everything a little
more centralized. I don't like having it in the /usr/X11R6/ directory because
the best way to upgrade or even get a new installation of XFree86 is normally
easier when getting rid of the entire /usr/X11R6 directory. But following is
how to compile Blackbox:

./configure --prefix=/usr --with-x --enable-slit &&
make &&
make install

Command Explanation:
	./configure --prefix=/usr --with-x --enable-slit
	You should know what --prefix does. I put in --with-x just to make
	sure it uses X. Of course this isn't necessary but I like to use it 
	for the sake of completeness. --enable-slit is also not necessary
	but I use it for completeness sake as well. We'll talk about the 
	slit more later on.

6. Editting ~/.xinitrc
-------------------------
Once you have installed Blackbox you will have to edit your ~/.xinitrc file to
make sure it reflects that Blackbox is now installed and working. If you have
no other window managers than edit the line in your ~/.xinitrc that has
	exec fvwm
as the list line of the file to the following
	exec /usr/bin/blackbox

If you have more than one window manager then you will have to add Blackbox to
your ~/.xinitrc in whatever way you add window managers. 

For more information and a good ~/.xinitrc for changing window managers see:
http://www.rapierbit.org/linux/winmgrs.html

7. Starting Blackbox
-------------------------
If you have only one window manager like Blackbox in your ~/.xinitrc then all
you have to do is the following ($ signifies prompt):

$ startx

If you have an ~/.xinitrc that takes arguments for different window managers
than add the argument to the above to get blackbox started. For instance for
my personal system I use the following

$ startx blackboxBeta

This should load your brand new Blackbox window manager. If you have never
used it before right-click on the mouse will bring up the menu.

8. TODO List
-------------------------
	1. Add configuration information
	2. Add bbkeys information
	3. Add bbconf information
	4. Add other sources for blackbox information
