INTRODUCTION
============

From Sylpheed's README :

<quote>
Sylpheed is an e-mail client (and news reader) based on GTK+, running on
X Window System, and aiming for

  * Quick response
  * Graceful, and sophisticated interface
  * Easy configuration, intuitive operation
  * Abundant features
</quote>

The user interface is quite similar to the UI of Outlook Express and
other Windows e-mail client.

The messages are managed  in the MH format, so that Sylpheed is compatible
with other e-mail clients using this format; and fetchmail and/or procmail.

Sylpheed is released under the GPL.

REQUIREMENTS
============

As Sylpheed is a X11 application (written using GTK+), it requires of 
course X11. One will assume that X11 has been installed according to the
BLFS book.

To build Sylpheed, you will need the following library

-  GTK+ 1.2.6 or higher (the current version is 1.2.10)

GTK+ itself requires some libraries (listed here with their current
version number) :

- libtiff 3.5.7
- libpng 1.2.3
- libjpeg 6b
- libungif 4.1.01b1
- glib 1.2.0

Optionally, you can use :
- libssl 0.9.6e for SSL support
- GPGME 0.2.3 or later for GnuPG support

The following libraries are recommanded :

- gdk-pixbuf 1.18.0
- imlib 1.9.14

The build process of most of these libraries is described in the BLFS book.

The build process of GnuPG is not described in the BLFS book but 
is rather straightforward

   GnuPG can be obtained from http://www.gnupg.org.

   tar xzvf gnupg-1.0.7.tar.gz /usr/src
   cd /usr/src/gnupg-1.0.7
   ./configure --prefix=/usr
   make 
   make install
   gpg --gen-key

Note : the command  
             gpg --gen-key
       will create a new key pair for the current user, and store it into
       the directory ~/.gnupg
       It should therefore be executed for each user that will use gnupg.

The build process of GPGME is not described in the BLFS book but 
is rather straightforward

   GPGME can be obtained from http://www.gnupg.org/gpgme.html

   tar xzvf gpgme-0.3.8.tar.gz /usr/src
   cd /usr/src/gpgme-0.3.8
   ./configure --prefix=/usr
   make 
   make install

compface
--------

  compface is an optional progam aimed at compressing/decompression
  small (48x48) images to be put in mail headers, under the field name
  X-Face.
  i've never meet any e-mail with some X-face header, but if yuo want to
  support it in sylpheed , you can get it from
  http://freshmeat.net/projects/compface/

  The compilation goes as follows:
   
     tar xzvf compface-1.4.tar.gz /usr/src
     cd /usr/src/compface-1.4
     ./configure --prefix=/usr
     make
     make install

libjconf
--------

  By default, Sylpheed supports US-ASCII, ISO-8859-1, and EUC-JP.
  For other character sets and/or encodings (UTF-8, KOI8-R, and GB2312)
  you need to install libjconv, which is a wrapper for iconv()	
  According to Sylphhed documentation, you can download it from :

       http://www.kondara.org/libjconv/index.html

  However, I have been unable to reach the site http://www.kondara.org/,
  and i don't know if it exists any more.

ldap
----

  The support of LDAP is mentionned in the change log but not in the 
  install file.
  If you download openldap-2.1.3.tgz from http://www.openldap.org/
  or one of its mirrors, and compile it, using the usual routine :
     tar -xzvf openldap-2.1.3.tgz /usr/src
     cd /usr/src/openldap-2.1.3
     ./configure --prefix=/usr
     make 
     make install
  and if you execute Sylpheed configuration with the option --enable-ldap
  you'll make it happily tell you that it uses LDAP.
  As i didn't test it; I cannot tell you more for the time being.

JPilot
------

  Sylpheed has support for JPilot, a Palm Pilot organizer that runs under
  Linux. As i don't have a Palm Pilot, I cannot comment on that functionality.
  If you are interested, see the site http://www.jpilot.org/ and add option
  --enable-jpilot to Sylpheed's configure command.


GETTING Sylpheed
================

  Sylpheed home page is : http://sylpheed.good-day.net/
  You can find there a .tar.gz and a .tar.bz2 archive.
  The current version is 0.8.1

  Note : there is also a "bleeding edge" advanced version named
         Sylpheed-claws, available from http://sylpheed-claws.sourceforge.net/
         Its version is called  0.8.1.claws


BUILDING Sylpheed
=================

  The build process is as follows:

    tar tzvf sylpheed-0.8.1 /usr/src
    cd /usr/src/sylpheed-0.8.1
    ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-ssl --enable-gpgme  --enable-ldap
    make
    make install

 
  Note : the option --enable-ssl is used to enable SSL support; you can omit
         it if you don't have openssl, or do not wish SSL support

         the option --enable-gpgme is used to enable GnuPG support; 
         you can omit it if you don't have GnuPG, or do not wish SSL support

         the option --enable-ldap is used to enable LDAP support; you can omit
         it if you don't have LDAP or don't want to use it with Sylpheed.

         the default installation directory for Sylpheed is /usr/local/bin
         the option --prefix=/usr indicates that we want it to be installed
         into /usr.

         it is possible to enable IPv6 support by using the configure option
         --enable-ipv6. As my LFS box does not support IPv6, I cannot comment
         on this functionality.

         it is possible to enable JPilot support by using the configure option
         --enable-jpilot.

  
CONFIGURING Sylpheed
====================

If you want to have the interface of Sylpheed in a language different
from English, you must set an environment variable before launching 
Sylpheed. For instance, to have it in German :
   export LANG=de_DE
or in French :
   export LANG=fr_FR

When a user runs Sylpheed for the first time, the program creates
its private files under ~/.sylpheed; and asks the user for
the location of the mailbox, the default being ~/Mail.

When in Sylpheed, you will have to create one or several accounts,
through the menu item Configuration/ Create new account.
You will have to create one or several POP3 or IMAP account(s)
to access your e-mails, and one or several NNTP accounts to
access the news.

To have access to the documentation (which is in HTML), you might need to
configure the command to call your browser. You can reach it through
the menu Configuration / Common preferences, and then select the
tab "Other" in the dialog (you might have to scroll the tab list to the
right to see it).
The default is to call netscape, but you could for instance call mozilla
using the following command, assuming Mozilla is in your PATH:

      mozilla -remote 'openURL(%s)'

IMPORTING MESSAGES
==================

If you have some OutlookExpress mailbox that you want to import to Linux, 
you can get liboe from http://www.gpl.no/liboe/.
You can then download liboe-0.92.tar.gz, decompress it and
compile oe2mbx : 
    make oe2mbx

The program oe2mbx will read your Outlook Express mailbox (.dbx)
and create a .mbx file that you will be able to import into Sylpheed
using the menu item File / Import mbox file...
