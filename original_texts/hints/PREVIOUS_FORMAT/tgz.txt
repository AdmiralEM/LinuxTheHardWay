TITLE:		"make install" tracking, using slackware tools & checkinstall
LFS VERSION:	2.4.4
AUTHOR:		Michenaud Laurent <lmichenaud@free.fr>

SYNOPSIS:
	Short guide, on how to be able to build .tgz from tarball.

HINT:
VERSION: 1.0	18-04-2001

	One major problem with lfs is how to upgrade properly. When you do a
	"make install", you don't really know which files are installed. Then,
	if you want to upgrade properly, you have to remove the old files. If
	there are no "make uninstall", it is a big problem. This hint explains
	you how to build .tgz from a tarball install using the slackware package
	system and the program checkinstall.

What you need :

- The slackware package tools avaible on www.slackware.com. 
	The name of the package is :
	hdsetup.tgz
	
- Checkinstall program 
	http://mayams.net/~izto/checkinstall-en.html


1 -  Installation of the slackware package tools
------------------------------------------------

tar zxvf hdsetup.tar.gz
cd hdsetup/sbin

# Only these progs are useful :
cp explodepkg installpkg makepkg removepkg upgradepkg pkgtool.tty /usr/sbin/

# Giving executable modes if not gived before
cd /usr/sbin
chmod u+x explorepkg installpkg makepkg removepkg upgradepkg pkgtool.tty

# Rename of pkgtool
mv pkgtool.tty pkgtool

# Need some directory to keep log of installed packages
cd /var/log
mkdir packages scripts setup setup/tmp


2 - Installation of checkinstall
--------------------------------

tar zxvf checkinstall-1.3.2.tgz
cd checkinstall-1.3.2

# If you want to install checkinstall in another directoty than /usr/local/bin ( default ),
# you have to edit the following files and change the PREFIX :
	Makefile
	InstallWatch/Makefile

# Compiling
	make
	make install

# If before, you have changed the PREFIX, you have to edit the checkinstall script
# located in the directory where you have installed it.
# You have to change in this script the prefix for the three programs : checkinstall, installwatch, makepkg  

# Run checkinstall
checkinstall


3 - Example on how to use it ?
------------------------------

# No changes for the beginning
	tar zxvf xmms-1.2.2.tar.gz
	cd xmms-1.2.2
	./configure
	make

# Some classical files will have to be integrated in the .tgz file
# This step is not compulsory
	mkdir doc-pak
	cp README INSTALL COPYING Changelog TODO CREDITS doc-pak/

# Now, we have to create the .tgz and to install the files on your system
# if it is make install, just run
	checkinstall
# if not, ( example make install-strip ), run
	checkinstall make install

# Now, xmms is installed on your system and you have a xmms-1.2.2.tgz in source tree.
# To uninstall xmms from your system, run :
	removepkg xmms-1.2.2.tgz
# To install again, run 
	installpkg xmms-1.2.2.tgz
	
	
4 - Others things
-----------------

There are X11 programs to manage the tgz packages. They didnot work well with
me that is why i will use only console tools.

Checkinstall can create rpm files too. I didnot choose rpm because tgz tools needs only
a bash to work. Rpm needs librairy and is more complicated. When you will have to do
something in rescue phasing for example, tgz tools will have more chances to work properly
than a rpm system.
