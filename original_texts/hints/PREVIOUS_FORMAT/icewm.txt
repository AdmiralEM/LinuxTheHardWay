REQUIREMENTS
============

As IceWM is a window manager, it requires of course X11.
One will assume that X has been installed according to the
BLFS book.

To build XIceW, you will need the following libraries

- libXpm (required)
- Imlib (optional, for wider image support)
- zlib (required by gnome-libs)
- libpng (required by gnome-libs)
- libjpeg (required by gnome-libs)
- libtiff (required by gnome-libs)
- libungif  (required by gnome-libs)
- DB (required by gnome-libs)
- gtk+ 1.2.xx (required by gnome-libs)
- gnome-libs (optional, for gnome menu support)
- sgml2html (optional, to rebuild HTML documentation)
- XFreeType (optional, for antialiasing)

IceWM is released under the LGPL.

BUILDING THE REQUIRED LIBRARIES
===============================

libXpm
------
  XPM is a format for storing/retrieving X Pixmaps
  from/to files

  current version : 3.4k
  where to get it : http://koala.inria.fr/ftp/pub/xpm/
                    ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/libraries
  how to build it :

       tar xzvf xpm-3.4k.tar.gz /usr/src
       cd /usr/src/xpm-3.4k
       xmkmf -a
       make
       make install

  note : by default, Xpm is installed in the X11 tree

Imlib
-----
  The imlib package contains image libraries. These are useful
  for loading, rendering and dithering a wide variety of image data formats.

  see BLFS book

zlib
----

libpng

libjpeg

libtiff

libungif
--------

DB

  see BLFS book 

ORBIT
-----
  Instructions to build ORBIT are not yet available in the BLFS

  current version : 0.5.17
  where to get it : ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/ORBit/
  how to build it :ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/ORBit/ORBit-0.5.17.tar.bz2

        tar xjvf ORBit-0.5.17.tar.bz2 /usr/src
	cd /usr/src/ORBit-0.5.17
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make
	make install

gnome-libs
----------
  Instructions to build gnome-libs are not yet available in the BLFS

  current version : 1.4.1.7
  where to get it : ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnome-libs
  how to build it :

        tar xjvf gnome-libs-1.4.1.7.tar.bz2 /usr/src
	cd gnome-libs-1.4.1.7
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make
	make install

sgml2html
---------
  sgml2html is necessary only if you want to update the documentation
  of IceWM. The original format of the docmentation uses linuxdoc
  (a SGML DTD previously used by the  Linux Documentation project,
  now replaced by DocBook XML)

  At the moment, i don't know where to get a .tar.gz distribution
  of linuxdoc-tools, that contains sgml2html.
  It seems to be  available as a RPM from Red Hat site, and a .deb
  from Debian site.


XFreeType
---------
  ...TO BE COMPLETED...
       
      
GETTING IceWM
=============

  IceWM home page is : http://icewm.sourceforge.net/
  The current version is 1.2.0


BUILDING IceWM
==============

  tar xjvf icewm-1.2.0 /usr/src
  cd /usr/src/icewm-1.2.0

  # if you dare to use experimental features :

  ./configure --with-imlib --enable-i18n --enable-antialiasing

  # otherwise

  ./configure --with-imlib
 
  #

  make
  make install
  make install-docs

  
  Notes : 
  - by default, icewm is installed into /usr/local/bin
  - by default, the configuration files are installed
    in /usr/local/lib/X11/icewm
  - by default, the documentation is installed in
    /usr/local/doc/icewm-1.2.0
    
  
CONFIGURING IceWM
=================

  To use IceWM as your window manager, you may call it from your .xinitrc
  file.

  The default configuration of IceWM is fully usable. If you want to 
  customize it anyway, you should create a directory ~/.icewm in your
  home directory and copy the files you want to modify from
  the global configuration directory /usr/local/X11/icewm.

  For instance, if you want to modify the menus, you should copy the file
  /usr/local/X11/icewm/menu into ~/.icewm

  Note that if a program is not installed, IceWm will not display it in the
  menu. The syntax for an entry in the menu is : 
    prog "<title>" <icon> <program> 

  For instance, the (very simple) menu definition for my LFS box is :

    prog xterm xterm xterm
    separator
    menu Applications folder {
        prog Emacs - emacs
        prog Mozilla - /usr/local/mozilla/bin/mozilla
        prog Sylpheed - sylpheed
    }
    menu Utilities folder {
        prog top top xterm -e top
    }
    menu "Window Managers" folder {
        restart twm - twm
        restart sawfish - sawfish
        restart icewm - icewm
        restart wmaker - /opt/wm/bin/wmaker
        restart enlightenment - /usr/enlightenment/bin/enlightenment
        restart blackbox - blackbox
        restart AmiWM - amiwm
        restart AfterStep - afterstep
    }

  If you want to change some defaults, you may copy in ~/.icewm the file
  /usr/local/lib/X11/icewm/preferences.
  For instance, i changed only an entry in this file, to change the default
  theme :

     Theme="Infadel2/Ergonomic.theme"
