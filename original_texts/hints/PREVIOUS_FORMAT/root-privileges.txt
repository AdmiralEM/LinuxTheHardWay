SYNOPSIS:
	How to prevent file deletion/modification, even from root.

HINT:
===========================================================================
Ed. note: as an unknown person explained:
"I was reading the lfs-hints and I came across the root-priveleges hint. I
am not sure if this is what was intended by the hint, but it sounds as if
any user can set this attr to a file and thereby prevent root from being
able to change/delete, etc.

That is not *quite* true. The superuser has to be the one to set and remove
the bit from a file. Once superuser sets this bit, then yes it is basically
unchangeable unless the bit is removed."
===========================================================================

A less-known feature of the ext2 filesystem:

  you can set a file to not be changable by anyone including root, like so:

        chattr +i somefile.txt

  this can be undone via the command:

        chattr -i somefile.txt

Like this even root can't delete this file. See man chattr for more
information.

e.g.: chattr +i -R /usr/lib would recursively  change  attributes  of
directories and their contents.
