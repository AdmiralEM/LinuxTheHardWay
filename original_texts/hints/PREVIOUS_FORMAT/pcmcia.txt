1. Preface
	                                                                             
I included an Errors I've encountered section, it's just a section
about how I changed some things to get my pcmcia netword card
setup properly.

There are two possibilities for using pcmcia:
					       
  - using the kernel pcmcia modules and the pcmcia-cs tools
  - using the pcmcia-cs modules and tools	


2. Getting the right stuff

Download the pcmcia-cs source package from http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/
Unpack the package into a directory, logical would be the /usr/src.

3. Configuring + install the kernel and pcmcia-cs package

   - Using the kernel pcmcia modules and the pcmcia-cs tools
											           
	When compiling the kernel during the LFS build, don't forget to 
	compile the right pcmcia modules, and compile the kernel as
	described in the LFS book.

   - Using the pcmcia-cs modules and tools

        Don't include the pcmcia support in the kernel. 
        It's located in general setup; PCMCIA/CardBus support.

After compiling the kernel, change to the pcmcia-cs directory and
execute these commands for BOTH methods:

	 make config
	 make all
	 make install

Do a reboot and the PCMCIA support should be working properly.


4. Errors I've encountered

I have a pcmcia NIC, it's my only nic, if you do have onboard nic, eth0 will 
be detected and the /etc/rc.d/init.d/network file will not generate an error.
(In the onboard nic case do not remove or chmod the network file)
The pcmcia daemon is started after the network is brought up. This resulted 
in an error because eth0 wasn't detected.

I configured /etc/pcmcia/network.opts (that shouldn't be too hard) so that a 
./network eth0 up is given by the input of the pcmcia nic, which dissolves 
the need of the disabled /etc/rc.d/init.d/network. 
After this do a 
	chmod 644 /etc/rc.d/init.d/network
and have a reboot, so you can check if it worked out allright.
If this works ok, go ahead and delete the /etc/rc.d/init.d/network file and 
all links to it.

5. More infomation

The PCMCIA-HOWTO is located in the doc directory in the 
pcmcia source dir.
