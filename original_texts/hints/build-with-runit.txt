SYNOPSIS: How to replace SysVinit with runit when you build LFS.

PRIMARY URI:
http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/index.php?pagename=Building%20LFS%20with%20Runit

IMPORTANT NOTE:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This hint is NOW UNMAINTAINED.  The Author no longer uses runit
and does not support using it.  The copyright is not chnged by this fact.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION:

The LFS book installs SysVinit and a set of bootscripts. Together
these provide the mechanism for starting processes that run under the
Linux Kernel, and every process is a child of 'init', process
one. Other schemes exist, notably the BSD-init scripts, but these are
just an alternative set of scripts. This hint uses runit
http://smarden.org/runit/ by Gerrit Pape, a completely different
scheme that replaces init, and all its paraphernalia (with its own
paraphernalia). Runit is derived from the ideas of DJ Bernstein, but
the applications can easily be installed in FHS conformant places.


PREREQUISITES: None. This hint should apply to all versions of LFS.

HINT:

Introduction
------------

There is a hint at http://109bean.org.uk/betterboot that explains how
to modify an existing LFS system to use runit. Those pages contain a
lot of explanatory text that is not repeated here. If you want
explanation, go and read that.


This hint will just show the minimal steps to build a fresh LFS system
using the book as modified by these instructions.


    Note: If you are reading this as a text document, you might find
    it better to look at the wiki version, which is maintained
    on-line. http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org


Obtaining Sources and Scripts
-----------------------------

Download the latest version of Gerrit Pape's packages from his website:

http://smarden.org/runit/runit-1.0.1.tar.gz

http://smarden.org/socklog/socklog-1.4.2.tar.gz

http://smarden.org/ipsvd/ipsvd-0.8.2.tar.gz

Note: There may be later versions - the ones above are the ones that
have been tested with these instructions

Follow the LFS book up to SysVInit
----------------------------------

Carefully follow the LFS book through all its chapters until you get
to the page concerning SysVInit. Now follow these instructions:

Building and installing runit
-----------------------------

A word of warning, runit is designed to be unpacked into a directory,
/package, which is neither LFS nor FHS conformant. These instructions
therefore build an LFS and FHS conformant version.


Unpack the runit tarball, it will unpack as admin/runit-1.0.1.

cd admin/runit-1.0.1
package/compile
cd command
install runit runit-init /sbin
install runsvdir runsvchdir runsv runsvstat runsvctrl  /usr/sbin
install svlogd svwaitdown svwaitup chpst utmpset /usr/sbin
cp ../man/* /usr/share/man/man8
ln -s /sbin/runit-init /sbin/init

Install runit's bootscripts
---------------------------

These scripts tell runit how to boot your system, how to run the
initial tty terminals, and how to shut down the system (including
forcing a shutdown with ctrl-alt-del). They depend on the
LFS-bootscripts that you will install in chapter 7 of the LFS book.

Obtain the scripts from the LFS Hints webpage's attachments link.
http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/attachments/

Continue from the LFS book
--------------------------

Now continue from the LFS book starting with the section after SysVInit.

The section How does the booting process with these scripts work? is
not relevant, and can be skipped.

Finally, you will want to understand what you have built, so visit the
runit webpages at http://smarden.org/runit.

You will also want to know how to build BLFS packages with runit
support, if so, visit the author's runit pages at
http://109bean.org.uk/betterboot.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

This hint started life on the LFS wiki (and the best version is still
maintained there).  Kind people make improvements to it there, so far
these are: Uli Fahrenberg, Anderson Lizardo.

CHANGELOG:

    [2004-03-25]
	*  Wrote the first draft on the wiki.
    [2004-03-29]
	*  Issued 1st Text version for the Hints project.
