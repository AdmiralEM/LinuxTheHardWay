SYNOPSIS: LFS package references

DESCRIPTION: This is an index to all the packages that make up
[1]Linux from Scratch (LFS). Under each package we list, in this
order:
 1. The homepage for the package, or the [2]freshmeat.net page if
 there isn't a homepage we know about.
 2. The URL of the manual, possibly the man page, but something to let
 you learn what the package does and how to use it. There are a few
 packages where we either have nothing yet to tell you here, or the
 homepage is the best reference for manuals that we know.
 3. Optionally, the URL's of interesting and informative material that
 may help you understand the package better, use it for some common
 task, or be otherwise educational.

PREREQUISITES: None.

HINT:

Why would I want to use this material?

You might ask if there is any value in this list: "doesn't the LFS
book contain all I need to build LFS?"

Well yes it does, but only just sufficient information, and a little
extra educational material so that you can troubleshoot as you
proceed. But what if you want to use your new LFS system? Don't you
want to know what you have just built?

Here is a starting place to understand the software you have already
installed, but have so far only used to build the system itself.

How is the document maintained, and how can I help?

When there is a new major release of LFS we review this document to
check if there are any new packages we need to include, or perhaps
some we don't need any more. Apart from that the content relies on
people like you sending suggestions to the document maintainer.

If you find a useful on-line document about one of the LFS packages,
just [3]send an email to the maintainer with:
 1. The URL of the material.
 2. A short explanation of why you think it should be included here.

You can also email to say you found something here to be less useful
than you hoped, but we may disagree!

You may feel that your current expertise is too lowly to contribute,
but you are wrong; it is only by using the experiences of people while
they are learning that we can find out which are the best learning
tools. Please take the time to give us some feedback if you can.

We are also interested in the views of people whose first language is
not English. However, because we only speak English fluently, it's
hard for us to maintain lists of good references for other languages.
If you can do that for your language we will happily provide a link to
your document.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: I have received encouragement and advice from
numerous people concerning this work. They are too many to list and in
any case, probably due to age, my memory is faulty.

CHANGELOG:

[2004-01-19]
 1st release as a text file. NOTE: only the on-line version is
 maintained actively.

[2004-12-28]
 Revised the online version. No significant content
 changes. Changed license to Creative Commons.  Removed unusable
 content from the text hint.
