1. What is WINE?
----------------
WINE is, as stated on its website, a free implementation of Windows for
Unix - in other words a program that enables you to run Windows
applications on your Unix-Box quite comfortably.
WINE also comes with a library called WineLib with which you are able to
compile source-code using Windows system calls, but since open-source is
not a big issue in the Windows world (most open-source stuff there comes
from ported Unix apps anyway) we won't discuss it here.

IMPORTANT: I assume that you have a native Microsoft Windows installation on
a separate partition and that it is mounted.
I do not have any experience with a full Windows replacement and won't give
you instructions on how to do this, because I don't like talking or even
giving advice about topics I am not competent enough with.


2. Requirements
---------------


2.1 Overview
------------
- X11R6, most likely the XFree86 implementation - see the xfree86* hints.
- Freetype2, if you want True Type support, which I assume.
- OpenGL libraries and header files (that is, if you want OpenGL support!);
	NVidia-users read nvidia_glx.txt, others install the Mesa libs:
	http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mesa3d/MesaLib-4.0.4.tar.bz2?download


2.2 Installation notes
----------------------
Modify the file

	include/freetype/config/ftoption.h

in the Freetype2 source tree:

Change the line

	#undef  TT_CONFIG_OPTION_BYTECODE_INTERPRETER

to

	#define TT_CONFIG_OPTION_BYTECODE_INTERPRETER

and compile Freetype2 with the usual

./configure --prefix=/usr/X11R6 --with-gnu-ld
make
make install
ldconfig

Be root when executing the last two commands.


3. Getting, configuring and compiling WINE
------------------------------------------
Get the latest snapshot from

	http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/ALPHA/wine/development/

Unpack with

	tar xvfz Wine-xxxxxxxx.tar.gz

and cd to directory Wine-xxxxxxxx.


Now there is more than one way to do the installation.
You can either do configuring and compiling for yourself
or use tools/wineinstall. The latter method is more convenient,
because it automatically creates a configuration file and
is able to find your Windows partition (if it is mounted).

I will use a combination to get the best of both worlds :)
First, type

./configure --help

read the available options and pick what you need.
Run configure again with these options and check whether
all you want (most notably Freetype2 and OpenGL) was found.
To get really sure that OpenGL support will be build, type

	cat include/config.h | grep OPENGL

If the output of this command doesn't say

	#define HAVE_OPENGL 1

OpenGL won't be built and there's a problem to fix!

NOTE: Remember to delete config.cache when re-configuring.

If you are content with the output of configure, enter
the directory tools and open the file 'wineinstall'
with your favorite editor. Skip the big comment block at the
beginning and look at the configuration defaults. You may want
to change 'CONFARGS' to reflect your desired configure options
(e.g. --enable-opengl) and 'prefix' to select the installation
prefix. If it is requested, I will provide sed statements and a
small script for this.

Bear with me, we're almost done:
Go back to the toplevel source dir, execute

	tools/wineinstall

answer a few questions and get some coffee.


4. Postconfiguration
--------------------
Impatient people like me can go straight to step 5 and try
to start a simple application like Solitaire. If it doesn't
work or you want to know more about WINE configuration, you
can always return to this step.

Review the file ~/.wine/config with your favorite editor.
If you do not have this file (probably because you installed
WINE without wineinstall), copy

	WINESOURCEDIR/documentation/samples/config

to ~/.wine/config

Comments in the config file are denoted with a semi-colon (;),
statements are terminated by a newline.
First section is about drives. Syntax example:

	[Drive C]
	"Path" = "/mnt/win"
	"Type" = "hd"
	"Filesystem" = "vfat"

You should use fstype 'vfat' for hard-disk partitions and
fstype 'win95' for Floppy disk and CD-ROM drives. I can't tell
you what type of fs you need to use with NTFS partitions, probably
it doesn't work with those as NTFS kernel support is still
considered experimental.

Next section is [wine] and contains essential configuration information.
Configuration format is like the one above:

	"Variable" = "Value"

The relevant variables are:

windows - your Windows install directory, e.g.
	"windows" = "C:\\win98"

system - your Windows system directory, e.g.
	"system" = "C:\\win98\\system"

path - application search path, should be at the very least:
	"path" = "C:\\win98\\system;C:\\win98;C:\\win98\\command"

temp - a directory for temporary files, most likely this:
	"temp" = "/tmp"


If you want to know more about the configuration of WINE,
refer to reference [1].


5. Running applications with WINE
---------------------------------
WINE is quite easy to use once it is installed the right way:


wine ping (using the path-variable)
wine ping.exe
wine c:\\win98\\ping.exe (assuming "C" is mapped to the windows partition)
wine /mnt/win/win98/ping.exe

You can pass commandline parameters like this:

wine ping.exe -- -t localhost

Use CTRL-C to interrupt as usual.


6. Troubleshooting
------------------
Problem: Freetype-related files fail to compile
Solution: Remove _all_ old and conflicting versions of Freetype
	(both libraries and header files).
	Please note that XFree86 also brings a version of Freetype with
	it. You can find its files in /usr/X11R6/lib and /usr/X11R6/include.
