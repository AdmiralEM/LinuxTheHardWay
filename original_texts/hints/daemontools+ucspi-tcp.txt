SYNOPSIS:       Install and use daemontools-0.76 and ucspi-tcp-0.88

DESCRIPTION:    Since the BLFS Book has dropped support for daemontools and
                ucspi-tcp, I'm maintaining the install instructions at my
                website. I have added usage examples of my own.

PREREQUISITES:  A working Unix system with the usual development tools.


HINT:

DJ Bernstein's daemontools suite offers a very convenient way of starting
and controlling daemons. The package includes other highly useful tools like
multilog, which does automatic log rotation, or setlock, which can be used
in shell scripts to ensure that only a single instance of a program is running.

The ucspi-tcp suite contains tcpserver, a secure replacement for inetd,
as well as several other useful net-tools.

The BLFS book has dropped support for daemontools and ucspi-tcp, so I
maintain an updated version of the last install instructions at:
