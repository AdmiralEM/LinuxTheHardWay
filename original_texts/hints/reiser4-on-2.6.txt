PREREQUISITES:
Uuid must be installed (Included in e2fsprogs or e2fsprogs-libs)
libaal

HINT:
-> Refer to LFS if you haven't had e2fsprogs/e2fsprogs-libs installed
    (You need Uuid that comes with it)
    
-> Installing Libaal
        Get the latest libaal from reiser4progs folder (libaal-1.0.5.tar.gz)
        Build process:
        
        tar zxf libaal-1.0.5.tar.gz
        cd libaal-1.0.5
        ./configure --prefix=/usr && make && make install
        
-> Installing Reiser4progs
        Get the latest reiser4progs (reiser4progs-1.0.5.tar.gz)
        Bulid process:
        
        tar zxf reiser4progs-1.0.5.tar.gz
        cd reiser4progs-1.0.5
        ./configure --prefix=/usr --sbindir=/sbin  &&
        make &&
        make install
        
-> Patching 2.6 Kernel
        **Assuming you are running the stable 2.6.16 tree**
        
        Latest patch as of writing is reiser4-for-2.6.16-5.patch.gz
        
        cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.16.x
        gunzip -c reiser4-for-2.6.16-5.patch.gz | patch -p1
        
        Configure the kernel config with the following addtional features:
            [Enable] Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers
            [Enable] Deflate compression algorithm
            [Enable] Reiser4
            
        Build the kernel
        
-> Formating a Reiser4 partition

        mkfs.reiser4 /dev/<device> (Replace with proper device/partition)
        
        
-> Mounting a Reiser4 partition
        mount -t reiser4 /dev/<device> <mounting point>
        
        
That's all! You have the fastest filesystem on your LFS
        
        
FAQ:
Q: Where to find "Deflate compression algorithm"
A:     [Cryptographic options]
            [Cryptographic API]
                -[Deflate compression algorithm]

Q: I cannot find Reiser4 option
A: Ensure the 3 options are correctly set.

Q: Can I boot from a Reiser4 partition?
A: Sure! Lilo will boot perfectly. For GRUB fans, there is a seperate patch for 
   GRUB which is required.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
    * This is my first hint ^^v


CHANGELOG:
[2006-10-25]
  * Last update as Reiser4 seems no longer maintained and is never considered
    inclusion into Kernel.
  * More FAQs
  * Reiser4 now able to build on 4Kb Stack, thus remove the need for a
    8Kb kernel stack.
  * Updated Contact Info
[2005-08-06]
  * Initial hint.
