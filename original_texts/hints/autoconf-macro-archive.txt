TITLE:          GNU Autoconf Macro Archive
AUTHOR:         Kevin M. Buckley,
DATE:           2021-11-16
SYNOPSIS:       LFS-style install instructions for the Autoconf-archive
LICENSE:        GNU Free Documentation License Version 1.2

DESCRIPTION:

As no other package in {B,}LFS requires macros from the autoconf-archive
the {B,}LFS authors do not include any mention of it in the Books,

Should you, as I did, have a need to use macros from the Autoconf-archive,
then this Hint may be of use, in that it takes its text from a personally
rendered version of sources for a section for Autoconf-archive.

At the time of writing, the latest version of Autoconf-archive was
2021.02.19, although using other sources, older or updated, should 
just be a matter of replacing the date string, used for versioning,
with that of whichever sources you are looking to deploy.

Note also that the version in the example commands was deployed against
a slightly updated LFS version 11.0, although again, as the install
process only puts files at certain locations, the instructions in the
hint should work with any LFS version.

HINT:

Introduction to Autoconf-archive

Macro Archive, a collection of more than 500 macros for GNU Autoconf.


This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-11.0 platform.

Installation of Autoconf-archive


Note: The installation only requires that the macros get installed to
their correct location so there is no separate make command, nor is
there a test suite.


Install Autoconf-archive by running the following commands:

./configure --prefix=/usr \
            --docdir=/usr/share/doc/autoconf-archive-2021.02.19


Now, as the root user:

make install


Command Explanations

  --docdir=/usr/share/doc/autoconf-archive-2021.02.19

this ensures the documentation will go into a versioned directory.


Installed Directories:

/usr/share/aclocal
/usr/share/doc/autoconf-archive-2021.02.19
/usr/share/info

The first of those is where the macros will be placed, noting that
as LFS installs Autoconf, it should already exist, whilst the latter,
again a directoy that should exist on an LFS system, sees some Info
pages installed into it.
